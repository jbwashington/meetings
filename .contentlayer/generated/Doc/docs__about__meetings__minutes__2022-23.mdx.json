There are lots of 'emails' but it's not always easy for families to understand how to prioritize.   \n* **Blind Spots on PTA message efficacy**  \n  * Content overload within one email could be inhibiting PTA's ability to drive home the salient points.   \n* **Execution**  \n  * if we agree that two emails is the move, i.e. PTA Need-to-Know and Dyanthe's Weekly Newsletter, we'll work with Denise/Dyanthe to ensure they send out Dyanthe's letter on their own (vs PTA sending on their behalf); PTA can keep process as-is for our newsletter  \n* **Data-driven communication strategy**  \n  * Platform switch would be a biggie, but there is probably a lot we can do starting with open-rate and timing/segmentation (per what has worked with Advocacy)\n\n---\n\n## Oct 31, 2023\n\n* [Roles/Duties Office Staff 23-24](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CqeQJPluWODAHsrPPGmaNprTs8Fo1jkaNTMrN9fl6yM/edit)  \n* [Permits Detail.pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rJ534LSx2tyCveDn-PbWAy1zctWjIJcp/view?usp=drive_link)  \n* [PTA 9.26.23 Roles and Responsibilities Notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/118dTF0zdFhI3rjOg7HBfuTB_LZJy-3VKHkKICD4eT6I/edit)  \n  * [https://www.ps10.org/groups/78217/pta/executive\\_board](https://www.ps10.org/groups/78217/pta/executive_board)\n\n**Agenda**\n\n**Communication strategy Moving from Reactive → Proactive**\n\n- **Rain and air quality comms**  \n- **Teacher departures (Tiffany)**  \n- **Literacy curriculum**  \n- **5th Grade ‘grading’ system and middle school application**  \n- **Field trips/buses**  \n- **Neighborhood Day**  \n- **504 Protocols**\n\n* Photo Day Adriana and Alex  \n  * November date, TBD confirmation  \n  * Coordination w Dyanthe/Denise – aiming for 11/6-11/10\n\n\n* Finance committee  \n  * \\- NC on point to get this going with support from Lisa Skeen (and Adriana im positive I’ll lean on you a bit as well, just a heads up 😅)  \n  * \\- Auction playbook from last year \\- Amy  \n  * \\- annual give/ask materials, goals and timeline  \n  * Budget review/status since we need this for fundraising ask?  \n  * Website \\- Donate Page, Tax ID \\#  \n    * Alex  \n  * Corporate Matching push before EOY  \n  * Konstella annual ask live  \n    * Nicole  \n  * Advocacy \\+ Fundraising  \n    * EL Right to Read Screening \\- $25k sponsorship ask  \n    * Superintendent budget for events   \n    * Enrollment strategy (Press/Awareness \\- Chalkbeat)\n\n\n* Advocacy  \n  * quick review of agenda and literacy updates\n\n\n* Events \\- Tatiana on point   \n  * Nov and Dec Movie Nights  \n  * Pie Day (pre-Thanksgiving)  \n  * Holiday Fair?  \n    * Class parents – each has a table to staff (Tatiana to coordinate sign-ups and volunteer outreach with Matilde)  \n  * Ice Skating  \n    * Targeting 1st week after Dec/Jan break (pending Lakeside dates)  \n    * Teachers: Raja and Andy coordinating buses  \n  * Art Day \\- Amy  \n    * 11/11  \n    * $5k Goal  \n      * Model: Workshop with suggested donation  \n    * Insta, Website, D1 share-out  \n    * PTA Table  \n  * Permitting to be handled by Events Committee  \n    * Coordinate dates/calendar-keeping with Denise\n\n* Parent Engagement  \n  * \\- calendar review  \n  * \\- Shaquawn and Denise roles/responsibilities (I’m hoping to make this clearer as I shape infrastructure elements)\n\n\n* Infrastructure\\!  \n  * \\- NC on point — PTA operating needs, “how we work” in relation to TNS office/building roles/responsibilities   \n      \n  * Co-secretary, (Shannon)  \n    * agenda print-out  \n    * Minutes recording  \n    * Post-meeting: minutes shared with Alex for posting on website  \n  * Co-secretary, (Phoebe)  \n    * support  \n  * Co-president, Brooke  \n    * D1 rep  \n    * Newsletter editing  \n      * Committee head \\+ Cheryl \\+ Denise reminders  \n  * and co-treasurer roles:   \n    * Mario,   \n    * Stephanie Schall (liaison to Fundraising committee??)  \n  * SLT role in the PTA: ensure communication, divide and conquer  \n  * \\- another pass at defining co-president roles  \n  * \\- goals for the year\n\n## ---\n\n## Jul 19, 2023\n\n## Agenda\n\n* Quick review of major take-aways (positives/challenges) from the 22-23 school year (5 mins)   \n  * Discussion of office being bumpy  \n  * Budget for an assistant principal \\- does that lose   \n  * Yearbook effort  \n  * Art Day  \n  * Bake Sales  \n  * Idea for Photo Day– Use TNS parents as photographers \\- can Art Committee take it on?  \n  * Treasurer’s communication/tasks  \n  * Make community by example–invite all parents to Queens Night Market  \n* School Budget update – Timothy?

I also noticed from the FY cash it looks like expenses are coming in significantly under budget. Is this correct? I missed the treasurer's report last month and just want to make sure we are clear on expenses through Fall 23, summer cash needs, and projected P\\&L for Fall '23  \n  * Teacher reimbursements \\- timelines are typically EOY (can we nudge to get this earlier)  \n  * Event accounting to delineate expenses and income (can be solved with quick events retro)  \n* **In-Person meeting:** reminder that next week's PTA meeting on 5/16 is IRL in the small cafeteria. Due to attendance and participation, I'd like to propose moving all meetings to this time, and having a zoom Q\\&A/follow up for those who cannot meet in the mornings.  \n  * NC action item to change June schedule  \n* **Events events events**: there is a ton going on, we'll do another run through the tactical needs for various end of year events  \n  * Spring Fling Tactical  \n    * 6 tickets sold to date  \n    * Gaby on food (still a need)  \n    * Comms \\- everyone buy tickets and socialize with our peers in our classrooms; personalize the ask  \n      * Flier handout (stack in PTA room)  \n      * STAFF IS FREE\\!\\!  \n      * Class parent comms   \n      * What’s the TLDR/Value Prop when you are at the Spring Fling \\- free food, OPEN BAR, DJ, cool art to look at   \n* **Updates/Asks from Dyanthe/Admin**  \n  * Community Day \\- classroom cleanout etc  \n    * Combine with Spring Neighborhood Day (lead needed)  \n  * Nominating and elections  \n    * 22’23’ \\- no nominating committee?  \n      * Elections did not happen until October (narrative was that it was a COVID-related holdover)  \n    * D1 bylaws \\- should happen by May/June  \n    * Existing Roles  \n      * Adriana \\- planning to stay on  \n      * Adrianne \\- planning to step off  \n      * Amy \\- potentially interested to move treasurer role  \n      * Nicole \\- likely to stay  \n    * Comms  \n      * One sheet \\- backpack and digital  \n      * Link to existing doc  \n  * Single location dropoff/pickup: planning for 3rd Street for 23’24’ school year (cannot consolidate this year due to teacher bandwidth); note \\- teachers prefer the outdoor dropoff to indoor (thinking ahead to inquiries to bring students directly to classrooms as in pre-COVID years)  \n* **How we work and Planning for '23-'24**: Nominations and Elections are technically slated for June, but we don't yet have a nominating committee or lead. I also have a proposal for addressing a phenomenon I hear about often \\-- that 90% of the work is done by 10% of the parent community.  \n  * Seasonal planning   \n    * Why?  \n    * How? break up committee work and recruit more execution-level volunteers, specific to the season  \n    * For example  \n      * Fall: Fall Neighborhood Day, New Family Welcome Comms, Full Community survey, SING, Movie Nights, Bake Sales, Grant Screening, etc.  \n      * Winter: Ice Skating, Annual Ask, Advocacy \\- testing opt-outs, Grant Writing/Submissions, etc.  \n      * Spring: Spring Neighborhood Day, Community Day, Teacher Appreciation, Graduation, Auction/Spring Fling, Alumni Comms, etc.  \n  * Exec Committee  \n    * Include: Class Parent Lead, Comms Lead, Events Lead\n\n## Apr 11, 2023\n\n**Treasurers Report [Apr 2023 linked here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DEZTBxUgc_XICpd9AzPsuWqFBK39h6TE_LBFGdgiobw/edit#gid=921297764)**\n\n- Accounting   \n  - 2nd half of the year \\- teaching assistant position; check due **asap**  \n    - 1st half of the year may not have been paid?

We'll do our best to host some parent-led workshops outside and in the open spaces on the first floor, but I anticipate needing use of some of the second floor classrooms as well. Currently, we're targeting **March 25th**, but April 1st could be an alternate day if that is better. As soon as you approve a date, I'll be sure to fill out the permit ASAP and will reach out to STAR to see if we can borrow the dance studio again.  \n  + 2\\) Secondly, we're hoping to start planning for the return of **Movie Nights**\\!  I know you had given the PTA approval to hold an indoor Movie Night in February, but in looking at the calendar it seems like **March 3rd** is the earliest, most realistic option. Does that work? Then the other dates we have targeted are:  \n    + Friday, **March 31st** (Indoor)  \n    + Friday, **April 28th** (potentially outdoor? indoor back-up)  \n    + Friday, **May 26th or June 2nd** (outdoor)  \n  + 3\\) Finally, since we're having such a mild winter, we were wondering if we could re-launch **outdoor SING** at the end of **March (31st)** rather than the end of April. In addition to it being such an important community-building tradition, it is also tied to successful bake sale fundraising so would love to fit one more in this year.  \n    \n\n## Prep for Dec 13 PTA meeting\n\n**1/17 meeting:**\n\n- **~~NC check that konstella is updated for morning meeting in cafeteria~~**  \n- Brooke, Adriana, Amy, Nicole \\- confirmed to attend  \n- Action items  \n  - Amy \\- notes from last meeting  \n  - Budget approval  \n- Committee leadership  \n  - Needs: Diversity, Community, Arts, Advocacy\n\n**Denise Asks**\n\n- Parent ambassadors   \n  - daycare outreach to speak for recruitment  \n  - non-English speaking  \n  - D1 Training (denise inquiring)  \n  - PTA room closet \\- for kids’ clothes ‘TNS exchange’ \\- Denise to keep inventory  \n    - PTA room cleanout (maybe Amy Warren to lead?) – next half day?  \n- Co-host event with PTA EOY before elections  \n  - Spring Parent appreciation \\- awards for participation \\- Class Parents, Tour Volunteers, D1 Event; also becomes recruitment for PTA  \n- Tour Guide needs/set up etc. (open to any current parent?) \\- at least 3 parents per tour session  \n  - Denise to share blurb \\- ie the kids lead and the parents are there to talk about school when relevant questions come up  \n  - Tuesday tour guide needs\n\n\n  \n**Dyanthe Asks**\n\n- Field Trip Grant \\- set up as a reimbursement does PTA need to issue a check?  \n- \n\n**Denise**\n\n- Parent ambassadors   \n  - daycare outreach to speak for recruitment  \n  - non-English speaking  \n  - D1 Training (denise inquiring)  \n  - PTA room closet \\- for kids’ clothes ‘TNS exchange’ \\- Denise to keep inventory  \n    - PTA room cleanout (maybe Amy Warren to lead?) – next half day?  \n- Co-host event with PTA EOY before elections  \n  - Spring Parent appreciation \\- awards for participation \\- Class Parents, Tour Volunteers, D1 Event; also becomes recruitment for PTA\n\n**Parent Asks**\n\n**Newsletter ongoing support**\n\n- Template  \n  - Dyanthe’s message  \n  - PTA  \n  - Volunteer Corner  \n  - Announcements (list TNSPresident email for inbound from parent community)  \n  - Fundraising\n\n**Treasurers Report**\n\n- Fundraising  \n  - [Annual Ask](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJViH3Pj89ESw5mUvznHqJaL3cdv_6M37uRKRAzBpN4/edit)  \n  - Raised to Date  \n  - Meeting next week  \n- Budget voting  \n  - See Adrianne’s email\n\n**Volunteer Corner**\n\n- Ice skating  \\- Dyanthe to make the ask/callout community  \n- Diversity  \n- Tour Guides (covered above)\n\n**What’s Around the Bend** \n\n- [TNS Calendar 22-23](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Adz30N5psgYkrWyTf8YDbtMkpnc5yq_dPmaWpjtyOLY/edit#gid=0) (internal)  \n  - HIstorical: [2018/2019 Calendar/Committee Leads](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XDox1pAia1TL_xGZ04jGE7EKeUYnrjVxI1NxG3mYZ-g/edit#gid=1972890706)  \n- Community Engagement Survey / NPS  \n- Graduation \\+ Yearbook\n\n**Admin reminders (exec only)**\n\n- PTA mailbox  \n- Domain name expiration notice → Alex Estes  \n- New Victory Theater tickets (auction winner) \\--\\> Amy\n\n\n## \n\n## Dec 7, 2022 \n\n## Prep for Dec 13 PTA meeting\n\nPre-Comms w Dyanthe (Nicole)\n\n- Indoor events for winter?

Historically,  TNS Committees, made up of staff and parents, were core structures in our school.  They moved us along in our work as a small, progressive, and fiercely independent school within a much larger system.  They included the Diversity Committee, the Advocacy Committee, the Grants Committee, the Garden Committee, the Wellness Committee, and the Health and Safety Committee, to name a few.  Some of these were in response to issues facing TNS that particular year; others are long-lasting because the work is continuous and ever-evolving.   While some of these committees are still active, others must be revived and reimagined post-COVID.    |\n| ----- |\n\n## Nov 11, 2022 | [PTA Exec intro & Handoffs](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=MjdtdG9rdWNqc3V1ZGRmNnZ1amplNDNhdDAgbmljb2xlQHRoZXNwbGVuZGlkc3Bvb24uY29t)\n\nAttendees: [Amanda Riesman](mailto:amandariesman@gmail.com) [Adriana Hammonds](mailto:aohammonds@gmail.com) [A P](mailto:apoueymirou@gmail.com) [Timothy Tait](mailto:bottledspider@gmail.com) [brookemoreland@gmail.com](mailto:brookemoreland@gmail.com) [The Chanquists](mailto:chanquist@gmail.com) [Coral Nogueras](mailto:coral.nogueras@gmail.com) [Nicole Centeno](mailto:nicole@thesplendidspoon.com) [santiago.adrianne@gmail.com](mailto:santiago.adrianne@gmail.com)\n\n## Group Prompt\n\n*What’s your ‘one thing’ you’d like us to focus on this year?*\n\nTimothy\n\n* \n\nBrooke\n\n* \n\nAmy\n\n* Encouraging more parents to play leadership roles; bringing back \n\nAdrianne\n\n* \n\nAdriana\n\n* \n\nCoral\n\n* \n\nNicole\n\n* Defining the role of president as conduit between parents, teachers and Dyanthe \\- clarifying the most pressing issues of our community and helping to create a path to make it easier for parents to get involved/keep building.\n\n## \n\n**Hand-off details**\n\n* Aimee suggests talking about some of the hand-off issues in two ways: background context, and brass tacks of how things get done like Konstella  \n* Amanda shares document: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A3-pB6xrdEO4THMb74SgGnhk1YKIrEal-n4IqX\\_gJrk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A3-pB6xrdEO4THMb74SgGnhk1YKIrEal-n4IqX_gJrk/edit?usp=sharing)  \n* Amanda mentions Harvey Epstein, our assembly member, as an important contact to hold-on to as he’s a former PTA Pres. and accessible and has a discretionary fund for capital projects. His chief of staff is also very accessible  \n* SLT and Matt are facilitating the ongoing process of Title I funding and test scores  \n* PTA operational manual may have passwords that we are currently missing like the events gmail. Important questions: Do we need all of those email accounts? And if so, we need to follow-up with Cheryl, who we think is the point person on the TNS time.   \n* Amanda suggests that the secretaries review doc and maybe coordinate/prioritize information and insert into Operational Manual  \n* Amanda suggests that we consider bringing in more people as leads for parent engagement, fundraising, and events to fill out the executive committee.  \n* There’s also the communication aspect and Amanda wonders if the secretary role can help out with specifically with newsletter; managing Konstella as well   \n* Timothy offers to help take over Konstella  \n* Question around Parent Engagement Officers of the PTA Exec Committee  \n* Also an overall structure for sharing notes and communicating with the rest of the parents should be discussed and improved. There is a need for someone to manage communication and priorities for Class Parents  \n* Discussion around how to consolidate/prioritize committees–single sign-ups vs. committee; question around how we let every parent know that there are opportunities for volunteering   \n* Amanda mentioned that there is an opportunity through Konstella to accept donations–monthly donations. Set it and hopefully people continue to renew it each and treat it something like Netflix.  \n* Amanda mentioned two other committees that could be re-invigorated: Wellness and Diversity Committee, which turned into the ABAR book club, which then dissolved because we didn’t have a co-parent lead. Amanda spoke to Raquel about relaunching these committees and suggested Arnette Scott  \n* Amanda wanted to raise a couple of budget questions  \n  * Currently ballet program, American Ballet Company, is not in the budget. Amy suggested asking Dyanthe since sometimes the school covers the program  \n  * Farm sleep-away camp is currently not being planned yet since the Farm won’t accept external groups–Follow-up with Grace about the other camp they’ve gone to.  \n  * Sex Ed needs to come back for 4th & 5th grades  \n* By-laws pending item: DOE wanted us to vote to approve Zoom meetings. Also approved the use of a debit card. Question worth asking again: can we officially have Venmo? \n\n\n## \n\n## Brass Tacks stuff\n\nPeople  \nCo-Pres: Nicole, Tim  \nCo-Secretary: Amy, Coral, (Robert?)  \nCo-Treasurer: Adrianne, Adriana  \nCommittee Heads  \nSLT  \nD1\n\nProjects  \nCommunity Events  \nFundraising Goals  \nCommittees\n\nProcess  \nKonstella\n\n* [Training](https://www.konstella.com/public/training.html)  \n* TNS \\+ DOE \\= Google  \n* PTA/Parents \\= Konstella\n\nCommittee Playbooks  \nEvent Playbooks\n\n*LikeWishWonder*\n\n- TNS as a community  \n- More parents in the community  \n- Pandemic feeling among parents moving more positive  \n- Zoom’d out\\!\n\n## 11/15 Agenda\n\n- Dyanthe \\- Principal’s report  \n  - Morning hour w Dyanthe topic: Newscycle  \n- Erin \\- Teacher report  \n- Turn the floor to PTA  \n  - Who/What/How: New Exec team, Calendar, Konstella  \n  - Treasurer's report, [22-23 Budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YAqkvNkFqWD6L_gMo3yhodY51l5BlIAu4VQBNlogMlw/edit#gid=1695590894), [Meeting Video](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1sIA83fiHt4yO9fpoo8GVOM0O7Ja6D-2H)  \n    - Action item: Annual Ask for family donation  \n  - Most pressing needs  \n    - Committees 1H/2H  \n      - \\*\\*Fundraising\n\n    \\- Bake squad: reminder that the thanksgiving pie sale is next week, tuesday and wednesday.

They moved us along in our work as a small, progressive, and fiercely independent school within a much larger system.  They included the Diversity Committee, the Advocacy Committee, the Grants Committee, the Garden Committee, the Wellness Committee, and the Health and Safety Committee, to name a few.
