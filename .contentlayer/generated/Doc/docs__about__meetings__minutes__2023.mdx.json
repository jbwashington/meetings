We'll do our best to host some parent-led workshops outside and in the open spaces on the first floor, but I anticipate needing use of some of the second floor classrooms as well. Currently, we're targeting **March 25th**, but April 1st could be an alternate day if that is better. As soon as you approve a date, I'll be sure to fill out the permit ASAP and will reach out to STAR to see if we can borrow the dance studio again.  \n  + 2\\) Secondly, we're hoping to start planning for the return of **Movie Nights**\\!  I know you had given the PTA approval to hold an indoor Movie Night in February, but in looking at the calendar it seems like **March 3rd** is the earliest, most realistic option. Does that work? Then the other dates we have targeted are:  \n    + Friday, **March 31st** (Indoor)  \n    + Friday, **April 28th** (potentially outdoor? indoor back-up)  \n    + Friday, **May 26th or June 2nd** (outdoor)  \n  + 3\\) Finally, since we're having such a mild winter, we were wondering if we could re-launch **outdoor SING** at the end of **March (31st)** rather than the end of April. In addition to it being such an important community-building tradition, it is also tied to successful bake sale fundraising so would love to fit one more in this year.  \n    \n\n## Prep for Dec 13 PTA meeting\n\n**1/17 meeting:**\n\n- **~~NC check that konstella is updated for morning meeting in cafeteria~~**  \n- Brooke, Adriana, Amy, Nicole \\- confirmed to attend  \n- Action items  \n  - Amy \\- notes from last meeting  \n  - Budget approval  \n- Committee leadership  \n  - Needs: Diversity, Community, Arts, Advocacy\n\n**Denise Asks**\n\n- Parent ambassadors   \n  - daycare outreach to speak for recruitment  \n  - non-English speaking  \n  - D1 Training (denise inquiring)  \n  - PTA room closet \\- for kids’ clothes ‘TNS exchange’ \\- Denise to keep inventory  \n    - PTA room cleanout (maybe Amy Warren to lead?) – next half day?  \n- Co-host event with PTA EOY before elections  \n  - Spring Parent appreciation \\- awards for participation \\- Class Parents, Tour Volunteers, D1 Event; also becomes recruitment for PTA  \n- Tour Guide needs/set up etc. (open to any current parent?) \\- at least 3 parents per tour session  \n  - Denise to share blurb \\- ie the kids lead and the parents are there to talk about school when relevant questions come up  \n  - Tuesday tour guide needs\n\n\n  \n**Dyanthe Asks**\n\n- Field Trip Grant \\- set up as a reimbursement does PTA need to issue a check?  \n- \n\n**Denise**\n\n- Parent ambassadors   \n  - daycare outreach to speak for recruitment  \n  - non-English speaking  \n  - D1 Training (denise inquiring)  \n  - PTA room closet \\- for kids’ clothes ‘TNS exchange’ \\- Denise to keep inventory  \n    - PTA room cleanout (maybe Amy Warren to lead?) – next half day?  \n- Co-host event with PTA EOY before elections  \n  - Spring Parent appreciation \\- awards for participation \\- Class Parents, Tour Volunteers, D1 Event; also becomes recruitment for PTA\n\n**Parent Asks**\n\n**Newsletter ongoing support**\n\n- Template  \n  - Dyanthe’s message  \n  - PTA  \n  - Volunteer Corner  \n  - Announcements (list TNSPresident email for inbound from parent community)  \n  - Fundraising\n\n**Treasurers Report**\n\n- Fundraising  \n  - [Annual Ask](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vJViH3Pj89ESw5mUvznHqJaL3cdv_6M37uRKRAzBpN4/edit)  \n  - Raised to Date  \n  - Meeting next week  \n- Budget voting  \n  - See Adrianne’s email\n\n**Volunteer Corner**\n\n- Ice skating  \\- Dyanthe to make the ask/callout community  \n- Diversity  \n- Tour Guides (covered above)\n\n**What’s Around the Bend** \n\n- [TNS Calendar 22-23](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Adz30N5psgYkrWyTf8YDbtMkpnc5yq_dPmaWpjtyOLY/edit#gid=0) (internal)  \n  - HIstorical: [2018/2019 Calendar/Committee Leads](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XDox1pAia1TL_xGZ04jGE7EKeUYnrjVxI1NxG3mYZ-g/edit#gid=1972890706)  \n- Community Engagement Survey / NPS  \n- Graduation \\+ Yearbook\n\n**Admin reminders (exec only)**\n\n- PTA mailbox  \n- Domain name expiration notice → Alex Estes  \n- New Victory Theater tickets (auction winner) \\--\\> Amy\n\n\n## \n\n## Dec 7, 2022 \n\n## Prep for Dec 13 PTA meeting\n\nPre-Comms w Dyanthe (Nicole)\n\n- Indoor events for winter?

Historically,  TNS Committees, made up of staff and parents, were core structures in our school.  They moved us along in our work as a small, progressive, and fiercely independent school within a much larger system.  They included the Diversity Committee, the Advocacy Committee, the Grants Committee, the Garden Committee, the Wellness Committee, and the Health and Safety Committee, to name a few.  Some of these were in response to issues facing TNS that particular year; others are long-lasting because the work is continuous and ever-evolving.   While some of these committees are still active, others must be revived and reimagined post-COVID.    |\n| ----- |\n\n## Nov 11, 2022 | [PTA Exec intro & Handoffs](https://www.google.com/calendar/event?eid=MjdtdG9rdWNqc3V1ZGRmNnZ1amplNDNhdDAgbmljb2xlQHRoZXNwbGVuZGlkc3Bvb24uY29t)\n\nAttendees: [Amanda Riesman](mailto:amandariesman@gmail.com) [Adriana Hammonds](mailto:aohammonds@gmail.com) [A P](mailto:apoueymirou@gmail.com) [Timothy Tait](mailto:bottledspider@gmail.com) [brookemoreland@gmail.com](mailto:brookemoreland@gmail.com) [The Chanquists](mailto:chanquist@gmail.com) [Coral Nogueras](mailto:coral.nogueras@gmail.com) [Nicole Centeno](mailto:nicole@thesplendidspoon.com) [santiago.adrianne@gmail.com](mailto:santiago.adrianne@gmail.com)\n",

They included the Diversity Committee, the Advocacy Committee, the Grants Committee, the Garden Committee, the Wellness Committee, and the Health and Safety Committee, to name a few.
