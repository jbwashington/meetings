Our practices and policies are rooted in anti-bias and anti-racist work, which involves the entire school community.  Our integrated, inquiry-based curriculum encompasses children’s interests and is responsive to the needs of each child.  We collaborate with families to foster a community that is supportive of the whole child.\n\n",
