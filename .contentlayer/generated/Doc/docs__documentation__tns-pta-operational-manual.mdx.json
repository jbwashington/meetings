Our practices and policies are rooted in anti-bias and anti-racist work, which involves the entire school community.  Our integrated, inquiry-based curriculum encompasses children’s interests and is responsive to the needs of each child.  We collaborate with families to foster a community that is supportive of the whole child.\n\n \n\n ## Parent Engagement:\n\n ## COMMUNICATIONS  \nEmail Newsletter Editor (with Principal and Parent Coordinator)  \nKonstella/GDrive/IT Administrator  \nWeb Content  \nDigital Design (social media)  \nEvents Calendar  \nPhotography\n\n ## Tasks:\n\n ## TREASURER  \nBookkeeping\n\n ## Tasks:  \nSubmit quarterly financial reports to DOE  \nWriting Checks  \nBudgets\n\n ## ADMINISTRATIVE NOTES  \n ## GDRIVE\n\n ## EMAIL ACCOUNTS\n\n ## DOE ACCOUNT  \n ## Outlook/Office 365  \n ## Zoom: nycdoe.zoom.us\n\n[01M363PA@schools.nyc.gov](mailto:01M363PA@schools.nyc.gov)  \npw: Pocket27\n\n ## DOE Newsletters/Content  \n ## FACE  \n ## CEC D1\n\n ## SPECIALTY GROUPS  \n ## BIPOC support group  \n ## LGBTQI support group (for students)  \n ## ABAR Book Club\n\n ## 2021 INITIATIVES\n\n1.

The election rules are specified in Chancellor's Regulation A-660.\n\nThe Chancellor recognizes that parent leadership is the cornerstone of the public schools. PA/PTAs and Presidents' Councils are autonomous and self-governing.

All changes to the template must also follow that regulation.\n\nFinances\n\nA PA/PTA is responsible for its own finances, and must obey certain rules and guidelines about banking, fundraising, and record-keeping. Any association that does fundraising must have a bank account to conduct transactions with vendors. Proper record keeping practices must be used by members of the executive board to give an accurate accounting of the association's finances.\n\nDues\n\nPayment of dues may not be used as a condition for membership and/or running for PA/PTA office.\n\n# \n\n# Committees\n\n| Committee | Description | Leaders required | Committee members |\n| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |\n| Elections | Coordinates timing and communication for PTA and SLT elections | 1 | 0 |\n| Advocacy | Coordinates |  |  |\n\n",
