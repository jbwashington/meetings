Elena, I can't add it to calendar because you made the event. This link should work for all our exec meetings moving forward if you want to add

Hey Dyanthe!
Brooke and I were going over the calendar today and there are a few hanging chads we need your help with since we know Denise is on leave (we really hope she is OK):

1) Looks like last school year's PTA gen meetings were a recurring meeting which continue into this next school year (they are reflected on the website calendar but not on the google calendar so need to be removed from the website)

2) This is the events doc that we were working off of at our last meeting before school ended. Some events are not on the calendar and we want to make sure those get added (specifically the 11/15 Friendsgiving Fall Fling; also want to confirm permitting for alcohol and kitchen use were requested). We are still determining dates for Art Day and Spring Fling so hold off on those.

3) We'd like to send out a PTA welcome letter but want to make sure that Konstella is ready (it looks like we might still be in last year's version?) Can you let us know when it's OK to send out?

4) Lastly, for my and Brooke's bi monthly meetings with you, do these following dates through the end of the year work: 9/10 (9am virtual); 9/25 (9 or 10am virtual); 10/6 (9 or 10am virtual or in person); 10/22 (9 or 10am virtual); 11/5 (9am virtual); 11/19 (9 or 10am virtual or in person); 12/3 (9am virtual); 12/17 (9 or 10am virtual or in person)

Thank you so much!!!!

Exciting Update: K/1 Classrooms and New Teachers
The Neighborhood School
Dear TNS Families,

I’m writing with some great news as we prepare for the upcoming school year: we are not closing a K/1 classroom. Thanks to the thoughtful and sustained outreach efforts by Denise and many members of our community, we now have enough students enrolled—and the corresponding funding—to support three K/1 classrooms this fall.

We still have open spots in both Kindergarten and 1st grade. If you know families who are looking for a wonderful progressive school community, please share the attached flyer and help spread the word. Posting on your social media or sharing directly with neighbors, friends, and parent groups can go a long way!

We’re excited to share some great news about our K/1 team. Dianne and Neddy will each continue teaching their own K/1 classes, just as they did last year. We’re also thrilled to welcome two new teachers to our community! Rachel Baron joins us with a wealth of experience from the Manny Cantor Center and the Peck Slip School. Adriana Yankovich also brings over a decade of teaching experience at the Locke School. We’re confident that Rachel and Adriana will be fantastic additions to our staff and bring so much to our school community. We can’t wait for you to meet them!

Thank you to everyone who helped make this possible. Your support and advocacy make a real difference.

Warmly,
Dyanthe

 Hey Amy,

Thanks for your email and for your response on all fronts.

For Art Day: is there a parent who has helped you in the past who you think would be a good candidate/ willing to take this on?
For the welcome back potluck: I love this idea if you or Alejandro (or someone else) want to spearhead it; I'll touch base with Dyanthe on that too 
For the Auction/Spring Fling, we will regroup about the date and see what works best
For the Liberty and Cyclones fundraisers, we can find people for these once school starts

Good note on Original Works and I also forgot about the book fair which I have reached out to Shannon and Danielle about to see what they are up for. 

I'll revert back with more info and/or questions as they come!

Happy Summer all!

I've cc'd Alejandro here, because on the SLT in the past year, we've talked a lot about creating new opportunities for parents and for teachers + parents to connect in the beginning of the year. One idea that came up was to bring back the welcome back pot-luck. Before the pandemic, on the Wed afternoon before school starts (this year: Sept. 3rd), we used to welcome families to bring food and beverages to the recess yard to meet new families and to get an official welcome from the PTA and Dyanthe. Teachers are in the school that day so I think teachers have been invited to say hello and to get some food. 

The hope is that such a welcome back would accomplish the following:
* Offer an opportunity for parents to connect with other families EARLY and to get the lay of the land and sign up for committees
* Offer an opportunity for teachers and parents to connect in a fun laid-back manner
* Reach/engage those who can't make any of the school year drop-off events/meetings

As for the events with my name next to it:
* I won't be organizing Art Day this year, but if there is someone who wants to do it, I'd be happy to pass-on all materials/suggestions.
* I won't be as involved in the Auction/Spring Fling so Malia/Brooke should be the primary contacts. But I will say the week after break is not a good time to schedule it. Last week in March?
* I don't think I'll do the Liberty game fundraiser again, but someone should, it's so easy. They should reach out to the NY Liberty groups person in February to lock in a good date and to get a chance to do the half-time fan tunnel for the kids, which will be so much more convenient than the pre-game fan tunnel.
* Kristen organized the Cyclones game but because I believe she left the school, someone else should be recruited.

Other thoughts/suggestions:
* It seems like a missed opportunity to not have 1 or 2 community events in the fall--such as a parents night out, Art Day, a community-wide potluck, or yes, a Neighborhood Day--when parents are most engaged/interested and willing to make a commitment.
* Original Works should probably be on this calendar, because 1) it's always an afterthought, and 2) there is an opportunity to organize an art-making day on the half-days to help parents who need childcare and to reach more families. I know James helped reserve our spot for next year so maybe he has some dates. We could easily double or triple what we've raised in the past by better planning/comms.

Thanks for getting this started nice and early Elena!
