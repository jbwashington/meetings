# Original Works Fundraiser - Turn Your Child's Art Into Lasting Treasures

The Original Works fundraiser is one of our most beloved annual traditions at The Neighborhood School, and for good reason! This unique program transforms your child's original artwork into beautiful, professional-quality keepsakes that families treasure for years to come.

## What is Original Works?

Original Works is a specialized fundraising company that takes student artwork and reproduces it on high-quality products. Your child creates an original piece of art at school, and you can order that artwork printed on everything from coffee mugs to tote bags, creating personalized gifts that grandparents, relatives, and family friends absolutely love.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Student Creates Art
Each student will receive an art kit containing:
- Special drawing paper optimized for reproduction
- Instructions for creating artwork that reproduces well
- Guidelines for using bold colors and clear lines

Students create their masterpieces during art class or designated fundraiser time, with guidance from teachers to ensure the best possible reproduction quality.

### Step 2: Artwork Goes to Production
Once collected, all artwork is professionally scanned and prepared for product printing. The Original Works team ensures each piece of art is optimized for the various products available.

### Step 3: Families Place Orders
Parents receive order forms showing their child's artwork and can select from dozens of product options. Orders are placed online or via paper forms, with multiple payment options available.

## Fall Fling Integration - NEW This Year!

This year, we're excited to announce a special integration with our Fall Fling event! Elena had the brilliant idea to set up an **art creation station** right at the Fall Fling where:

- Kids can create Original Works artwork on the spot
- Families can review product options immediately  
- Orders can be placed the same day
- It creates a fun, interactive experience for the whole family

This means you can enjoy the Fall Fling festivities while your child creates their masterpiece, and you can place your order before heading home!

## Supporting Our School

Every purchase through Original Works provides direct funding to TNS PTA programs. These funds support:

- **Educational enrichment programs**
- **Classroom supplies and materials**
- **School events and activities**
- **Technology upgrades**
- **Arts and music programs**

Unlike many fundraisers where families feel obligated to buy products they don't really want, Original Works creates items that families genuinely treasure and use regularly.

## Tips for Success

### For Students
- **Use bold, bright colors** - They reproduce better than light colors
- **Keep designs simple and clear** - Avoid tiny details that may not show well
- **Fill the entire paper** - This creates the most dramatic final products
- **Be creative and have fun** - The most personal artwork makes the best products

### For Families
- **Order early** - Popular items can sell out during busy seasons
- **Consider buying in sets** - Multiple magnets or keychains make great small gifts
- **Think ahead to holidays** - These make perfect personalized presents
- **Share with extended family** - Grandparents and relatives often want to order too

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What if my child is absent during art creation?**
We'll work with teachers to ensure every student has an opportunity to participate, including make-up sessions for absent students.

**Can we order products after seeing the artwork?**
Yes! You'll see your child's finished artwork before placing any orders. There's no obligation to purchase.

**What if we want to order more items later?**
Unfortunately, orders typically cannot be modified after the deadline due to production requirements. We encourage families to order everything they want during the initial order period.

**Are the products good quality?**
Yes! Original Works uses professional-grade materials and printing processes. Items are designed to last and maintain their appearance over time.

**Can relatives order directly?**
Relatives can participate by giving orders and payment to the family, but all orders must go through the student's family to maintain school coordination.
