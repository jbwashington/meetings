## Nov 28, 2023

**Agenda**

* SWAG orders, TBD (Mario and Vanessa connect yesterday)   
  * Mario update on Vanessa swag sale  
    * Travis making silk screens  
    * Amy talking to designers. Maybe Emil working with kids  
    * Emil and Alva working a booth  
* PTA table  
* Staffing: set-up, clean-up etc.   
* Decorations  
* Food- donations or vendors?  
  * Look into sponsors from local businesses  
  * Do parents have businesses to promote/add?  
* How money is handled  
  * Tickets for individual activities  
  * One time fee for box maze  
* Dyanthe \- teacher asks? Dyanthe has offered to have staff offer experiences for a raffle (i.e. lunch date with Cheryl)  
  * Movie with Shaquawn  
  * Sports with Andy  
  * Games day with School Support

**Events**

* Jan 12th and 19th   
* Lakeside

**New Teacher for 4/5**

* Still no teacher  
* Waiting from DOE

**Fundraising**

* Update from Nicole  
* We are very underfunded right now  
  * We didn’t have to pay for an assistant but still in deficit  
  * Less from events and direct donations  
  * A little bit from square  
  * No money coming through paypal or konstella  
    * We need to reask for this year. People may not realize that their recurrent donations aren’t happening  
  * Matt to ask Lizzie Simon’s guidance  
  * We need leadership on getting people to spread word  
* Annual Give/Ask to go out this week  
* Photos  
* Advocacy ticketed events?  
* Auction \- folder from last year? Johanna Birnbaum and Kate Doering are ready to start working on this event  
* Event recaps \- looping in Mario for Art Day etc.

**Treasurer**

* Vote Stephanie in at next PTA meeting

**Bank setup**

* Signatory update complete, one more visit to complete Debit card and Wire transfer capabilities

**Volunteer Needs**

**PTA Treasurer Candidate-** Stephanie Skaf \- we have bio- do we need to vote?

**Newsletter Communications \- Thought starters below**

* **Email Noise and perception of 'too much stuff'**  
  * Konstella email notification system contributes to this as well. There are lots of 'emails' but it's not always easy for families to understand how to prioritize.   
* **Blind Spots on PTA message efficacy**  
  * Content overload within one email could be inhibiting PTA's ability to drive home the salient points.   
* **Execution**  
  * if we agree that two emails is the move, i.e. PTA Need-to-Know and Dyanthe's Weekly Newsletter, we'll work with Denise/Dyanthe to ensure they send out Dyanthe's letter on their own (vs PTA sending on their behalf); PTA can keep process as-is for our newsletter  
* **Data-driven communication strategy**  
  * Platform switch would be a biggie, but there is probably a lot we can do starting with open-rate and timing/segmentation (per what has worked with Advocacy)

## May 9, 2023

* **Treasurer's Report**: Adrianne or Adriana as a heads up we will need to have a treasurer's report ready for the PTA meeting next week. I also noticed from the FY cash it looks like expenses are coming in significantly under budget. Is this correct? I missed the treasurer's report last month and just want to make sure we are clear on expenses through Fall 23, summer cash needs, and projected P\&L for Fall '23  
  * Teacher reimbursements \- timelines are typically EOY (can we nudge to get this earlier)  
  * Event accounting to delineate expenses and income (can be solved with quick events retro)  
* **In-Person meeting:** reminder that next week's PTA meeting on 5/16 is IRL in the small cafeteria. Due to attendance and participation, I'd like to propose moving all meetings to this time, and having a zoom Q\&A/follow up for those who cannot meet in the mornings.  
  * NC action item to change June schedule  
* **Events events events**: there is a ton going on, we'll do another run through the tactical needs for various end of year events  
  * Spring Fling Tactical  
    * 6 tickets sold to date  
    * Gaby on food (still a need)  
    * Comms \- everyone buy tickets and socialize with our peers in our classrooms; personalize the ask  
      * Flier handout (stack in PTA room)  
      * STAFF IS FREE\!\!  
      * Class parent comms   
      * What’s the TLDR/Value Prop when you are at the Spring Fling \- free food, OPEN BAR, DJ, cool art to look at   
* **Updates/Asks from Dyanthe/Admin**  
  * Community Day \- classroom cleanout etc  
    * Combine with Spring Neighborhood Day (lead needed)  
  * Nominating and elections  
    * 22’23’ \- no nominating committee?  
      * Elections did not happen until October (narrative was that it was a COVID-related holdover)  
    * D1 bylaws \- should happen by May/June  
    * Existing Roles  
      * Adriana \- planning to stay on  
      * Adrianne \- planning to step off  
      * Amy \- potentially interested to move treasurer role  
      * Nicole \- likely to stay  
    * Comms  
      * One sheet \- backpack and digital  
      * Link to existing doc  
  * Single location dropoff/pickup: planning for 3rd Street for 23’24’ school year (cannot consolidate this year due to teacher bandwidth); note \- teachers prefer the outdoor dropoff to indoor (thinking ahead to inquiries to bring students directly to classrooms as in pre-COVID years)  
* **How we work and Planning for '23-'24**: Nominations and Elections are technically slated for June, but we don't yet have a nominating committee or lead. I also have a proposal for addressing a phenomenon I hear about often \-- that 90% of the work is done by 10% of the parent community.  
  * Seasonal planning   
    * Why?  
    * How? break up committee work and recruit more execution-level volunteers, specific to the season  
    * For example  
      * Fall: Fall Neighborhood Day, New Family Welcome Comms, Full Community survey, SING, Movie Nights, Bake Sales, Grant Screening, etc.  
      * Winter: Ice Skating, Annual Ask, Advocacy \- testing opt-outs, Grant Writing/Submissions, etc.  
      * Spring: Spring Neighborhood Day, Community Day, Teacher Appreciation, Graduation, Auction/Spring Fling, Alumni Comms, etc.  
  * Exec Committee  
    * Include: Class Parent Lead, Comms Lead, Events Lead

## Feb 7, 2023

## Topics for Discussion:

Suggestions from Amy:

  + Class parents \- appreciation, recognition  
  + SLT representative to share out at next PTA meeting (school policy and governance, ie fund distribution) (Nicole to reach out to Aimee)  
  + Valentines Day self-care (Timothy Class Parents comms)

+ Note to NC \- financial report review/sign (PTA pres email)

## Prep for Feb 15 PTA meeting

+ SLT (Aimee and Alex?), D1, and committee reports as part of agenda?  
  + Battle of the Bands  
  + Save for College Q\&A  
  + December [Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUJJ4PNRFS4AsFxq3r0ALIbUbvfQbE4KDyRnVRe9IHI/edit?usp=sharing) and January [Meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V17hEsXKEemOWAnGaPlUsonn-buKIwit-O7HKXV13Io/edit?usp=sharing)   
+ Dyanthe check-ins: [co-pres bi-weekly](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZZLCj5FEGeHivHglpZYG_tEVqVqgZop25PZAD4mgtq4/edit#heading=h.ajoblsurm79y) (missed last week) and Amy’s asks:  
  + 1\) First of all, we're hoping to host another **Art Day** on a Saturday at the school. We'll do our best to host some parent-led workshops outside and in the open spaces on the first floor, but I anticipate needing use of some of the second floor classrooms as well. Currently, we're targeting **March 25th**, but April 1st could be an alternate day if that is better. As soon as you approve a date, I'll be sure to fill out the permit ASAP and will reach out to STAR to see if we can borrow the dance studio again.  
  + 2\) Secondly, we're hoping to start planning for the return of **Movie Nights**\!  I know you had given the PTA approval to hold an indoor Movie Night in February, but in looking at the calendar it seems like **March 3rd** is the earliest, most realistic option. Does that work? Then the other dates we have targeted are:  
    + Friday, **March 31st** (Indoor)  
    + Friday, **April 28th** (potentially outdoor? indoor back-up)  
    + Friday, **May 26th or June 2nd** (outdoor)  
  + 3\) Finally, since we're having such a mild winter, we were wondering if we could re-launch **outdoor SING** at the end of **March (31st)** rather than the end of April. In addition to it being such an important community-building tradition, it is also tied to successful bake sale fundraising so would love to fit one more in this year.

Historically,  TNS Committees, made up of staff and parents, were core structures in our school.  They moved us along in our work as a small, progressive, and fiercely independent school within a much larger system.  They included the Diversity Committee, the Advocacy Committee, the Grants Committee, the Garden Committee, the Wellness Committee, and the Health and Safety Committee, to name a few.  Some of these were in response to issues facing TNS that particular year; others are long-lasting because the work is continuous and ever-evolving.   While some of these committees are still active, others must be revived and reimagined post-COVID.    |

## 

**Hand-off details**

* Aimee suggests talking about some of the hand-off issues in two ways: background context, and brass tacks of how things get done like Konstella  
* Amanda shares document: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A3-pB6xrdEO4THMb74SgGnhk1YKIrEal-n4IqX\_gJrk/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A3-pB6xrdEO4THMb74SgGnhk1YKIrEal-n4IqX_gJrk/edit?usp=sharing)  
* Amanda mentions Harvey Epstein, our assembly member, as an important contact to hold-on to as he’s a former PTA Pres. and accessible and has a discretionary fund for capital projects. His chief of staff is also very accessible  
* SLT and Matt are facilitating the ongoing process of Title I funding and test scores  
* PTA operational manual may have passwords that we are currently missing like the events gmail. Important questions: Do we need all of those email accounts? And if so, we need to follow-up with Cheryl, who we think is the point person on the TNS time.   
* Amanda suggests that the secretaries review doc and maybe coordinate/prioritize information and insert into Operational Manual  
* Amanda suggests that we consider bringing in more people as leads for parent engagement, fundraising, and events to fill out the executive committee.  
* There’s also the communication aspect and Amanda wonders if the secretary role can help out with specifically with newsletter; managing Konstella as well   
* Timothy offers to help take over Konstella  
* Question around Parent Engagement Officers of the PTA Exec Committee  
* Also an overall structure for sharing notes and communicating with the rest of the parents should be discussed and improved. There is a need for someone to manage communication and priorities for Class Parents  
* Discussion around how to consolidate/prioritize committees–single sign-ups vs. committee; question around how we let every parent know that there are opportunities for volunteering   
* Amanda mentioned that there is an opportunity through Konstella to accept donations–monthly donations. Set it and hopefully people continue to renew it each and treat it something like Netflix.  
* Amanda mentioned two other committees that could be re-invigorated: Wellness and Diversity Committee, which turned into the ABAR book club, which then dissolved because we didn’t have a co-parent lead. Amanda spoke to Raquel about relaunching these committees and suggested Arnette Scott  
* Amanda wanted to raise a couple of budget questions  
  * Currently ballet program, American Ballet Company, is not in the budget. Amy suggested asking Dyanthe since sometimes the school covers the program  
  * Farm sleep-away camp is currently not being planned yet since the Farm won’t accept external groups–Follow-up with Grace about the other camp they’ve gone to.  
  * Sex Ed needs to come back for 4th & 5th grades  
* By-laws pending item: DOE wanted us to vote to approve Zoom meetings. Also approved the use of a debit card. Question worth asking again: can we officially have Venmo?
