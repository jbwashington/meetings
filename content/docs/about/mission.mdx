### Our Mission

The Neighborhood School’s mission is based on our deep belief that children thrive when we build on their strengths and provide a safe and nurturing environment.  Our practices and policies are rooted in anti-bias and anti-racist work, which involves the entire school community.  Our integrated, inquiry-based curriculum encompasses children’s interests and is responsive to the needs of each child.  We collaborate with families to foster a community that is supportive of the whole child.
