 ## Purpose of this Document:  

This document was written as a manual for incoming TNS PTA members. It is common for the PTA to have new members each year and restart or abandon activities and practices. While evaluating our goals and methods is important, the goal of this document is to:

* Create consistency for the TNS community in terms of expectations and communications  
* Create consistency for the PTA in terms of goals and values  
* Maintain and sustain yearly operational practices  
* Continue with larger projects such as advocacy that may take longer than a PTA term or are institutional and part of the fabric of the school and purpose of the PTA

#  ## TNS MISSION

The Neighborhood School’s mission is based on our deep belief that children thrive when we build on their strengths and provide a safe and nurturing environment.  Our practices and policies are rooted in anti-bias and anti-racist work, which involves the entire school community.  Our integrated, inquiry-based curriculum encompasses children’s interests and is responsive to the needs of each child.  We collaborate with families to foster a community that is supportive of the whole child.

Elections

PA/PTA Elections must be held in the spring. At that time, the three mandatory officers (president, recording secretary and treasurer) are elected. This must happen before the last day of school. The election rules are specified in Chancellor's Regulation A-660.

The Chancellor recognizes that parent leadership is the cornerstone of the public schools. PA/PTAs and Presidents' Councils are autonomous and self-governing. School officials' oversight of PA/PTAs and Presidents' Council is limited to what is necessary to implement and enforce laws, policies, rules and regulations, and to protect the rights of students, parents and staff. (Chancellor's Regulation A-660)

Meetings

All PA/PTAs must hold at least:

* Ten monthly general membership meetings   
* Ten executive board meetings throughout the year  
* Quarterly meetings with the principal

Notification

Members must receive a minimum of 10 calendar days’ notice before the monthly meeting. This notice must include:

·   	The date, time, place that the meeting will be held.

·   	An agenda items that will be discussed

PA/PTA Bylaws

PA/PTA Bylaws are a set of rules adopted by members of the association. These rules govern the day-to-day affairs of the PA/PTA.

All bylaws must follow Chancellor's Regulation A-660. All changes to the template must also follow that regulation.

Finances

A PA/PTA is responsible for its own finances, and must obey certain rules and guidelines about banking, fundraising, and record-keeping. Any association that does fundraising must have a bank account to conduct transactions with vendors. Proper record keeping practices must be used by members of the executive board to give an accurate accounting of the association's finances.

Dues

Payment of dues may not be used as a condition for membership and/or running for PA/PTA office.
