# Active Grant Applications - 2025 School Year

## Immediate Priorities (September 2025)

### 1. DOE Sustainability Grant - $5,000
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Ready to Apply (Opens September 2025)
**Focus:** Garden/outdoor learning and play
**Assigned:** James
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Gather required documents (September)
- [ ] Complete application when opens
- [ ] Coordinate with Principal Dyanthe for support

**From Aug 14 Meeting:**
> "I think we should do the DOE sustainability grant, which is kind of like the lower hanging fruit for outdoor learning and gardening and play, and it's $5,000 for the garden. The grant opens in September, so I'll let you know about that."

### 2. Ashokan Grant Reapplication
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Planning Phase
**Focus:** Educational programming (previous year was $8,000)
**Lessons Learned:** Bus insurance paperwork must be completed BEFORE trip
**Action Items:**
- [ ] Early coordination with school administration
- [ ] Ensure all insurance requirements understood upfront
- [ ] Submit for full $10,000 this year

**From Aug 14 Meeting:**
> "We will apply again this year. So I did have a call with the program officer and she did encourage us to apply again this year and thinks that we'd [be successful]."

## Grant Strategy Approach (James's Method)

### Systematic Approach
1. **Compile comprehensive grant list**
2. **Rank by difficulty (1-10 scale)**
   - 1 = Easiest/lowest barriers
   - 10 = Most complex/highest requirements
3. **Start with easiest grants first**
4. **Work systematically through the list**

**From Aug 14 Meeting:**
> "I'm going to take that same methodology and work on the grants like that too. Like figure out what is the easiest grant to get us and make a whole list and then rank them from one to ten easiest to hardest and then start with the easiest and then work our way down the list."

## Document Preparation Priorities

### Critical Success Factor
**Paperwork preparation** identified as the slowest part of grant process

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create master document collection (legal, financial, organizational)
- [ ] Establish annual renewal schedule for time-sensitive documents
- [ ] Pre-prepare standard application components
- [ ] Create template library for common requirements

**From Aug 14 Meeting:**
> "So we just need to get the required documents together. That's the slowest thing, finding out the paperwork, where it is that they need. So we can have that on and we can make it fast."

## Budget Integration

### Current Budget Considerations
- **TA funding increase:** $20,000 â†’ $40,000 (impacts available funds for programs)
- **Ashokan shortfall:** Lost $2,000 due to insurance paperwork issue
- **Need for early budget meetings:** October and April general meetings

### Grant Revenue Targets
Based on event revenue analysis from meeting:
- Major events (Spring Fling/Auction): Highest revenue generator
- Multiple smaller events: $2,000-$3,000 each
- **Grant funding** can supplement event-based fundraising
- Goal: Reduce volunteer burnout while maintaining revenue

## Meeting Integration

### Executive Board Reporting
**Monthly agenda items:**
- Grant application status updates
- Upcoming deadlines and opportunities

- Budget impact analysis

### Timeline for Grant Season
- **September:** DOE Sustainability Grant application
