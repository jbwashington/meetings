## 500-Word Version

The Neighborhood School Parent Teacher Association (TNS PTA) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that has supported PS 363 (The Neighborhood School) for over three decades. Located on Manhattan's Upper West Side at 121 West 63rd Street, TNS is a progressive K-5 public elementary school serving a remarkably diverse community of over 350 students. Our school population reflects New York City's rich diversity: 40% of students qualify for free or reduced lunch, families speak more than 25 languages at home, and our community includes recent immigrants, long-time New Yorkers, and families from every socioeconomic background.

**Our Mission and Impact**

TNS PTA's mission is threefold: to enhance academic excellence through supplemental funding, to build an inclusive community that celebrates diversity, and to ensure every child has access to enrichment opportunities regardless of economic circumstances. We believe that public education is the cornerstone of democracy and that parent engagement is crucial to student success.

Annually, the PTA raises over $100,000 through diversified revenue streams including our signature fundraising events (Fall Fling, Spring Benefit), direct giving campaigns, corporate sponsorships, and grant funding. This remarkable achievement in a school where many families face economic challenges demonstrates our community's deep commitment to educational equity.

**Programs and Services**

Our funding directly impacts every child at TNS through:

- **Teaching Assistant Program ($40,000):** Two full-time paraprofessionals who provide critical support in classrooms, enabling differentiated instruction and supporting students with diverse learning needs

- **Arts Integration:** Comprehensive arts programming including visual arts supplies, music instruction, drama workshops, and visiting artist residencies that nurture creativity and self-expression

- **Technology Equity:** Ensuring all students have access to devices and digital learning tools, bridging the digital divide that affects many of our families

- **Experiential Learning:** Field trips to museums, theaters, and nature centers, including our flagship Ashokan overnight program that provides environmental education many urban students would never otherwise experience

- **Professional Development:** Supporting teacher training in progressive pedagogy, anti-bias education, and innovative instructional methods

- **Community Programs:** Cultural celebrations, family workshops, and events that build bridges across our diverse community

**Organizational Strength**

The PTA operates with a 12-member executive board and multiple committees addressing fundraising, events, advocacy, wellness, and diversity/inclusion. Over 100 parent volunteers contribute 5,000+ hours annually, demonstrating extraordinary community engagement. We maintain transparent financial practices with regular reporting to our community and careful stewardship of funds.

**Partnership and Collaboration**

We work in close partnership with Principal Dyanthe and school leadership, ensuring our support aligns with educational priorities and school improvement goals. Our advocacy efforts extend beyond fundraising to include engaging with elected officials like Council Member Harvey Epstein on education policy and funding issues.

**Commitment to Equity**

As a progressive school community, we're committed to ensuring economic barriers never prevent participation. We provide need-based assistance for all programs, maintain sliding-scale event pricing, and actively work to make volunteer opportunities accessible to working families. Our grants committee specifically seeks funding for programs that promote equity and inclusion.

The TNS PTA exemplifies how parent engagement and community partnership can transform public education, ensuring every child receives the rich, well-rounded education they deserve.
