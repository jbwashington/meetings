## 💡 PRO TIPS

### If Documents Are Hard to Find:
1. **501(c)(3):** Can request copy from IRS (takes time) or check old grant applications
2. **EIN:** Show up on any IRS correspondence, or call IRS Business line
3. **Board List:** Create one yourself from current roster, have President approve
4. **Minutes:** If missing, create brief summaries from memory/emails
5. **Bylaws:** If very old, use what you have and note "revision in progress"

### If Documents Don't Exist:
- **No audit?** Most small PTAs don't have one - that's fine
