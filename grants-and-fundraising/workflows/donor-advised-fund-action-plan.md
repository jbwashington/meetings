# Donor-Advised Fund (DAF) Action Plan
*Leveraging Fidelity Charitable & American Online Giving Foundation*

## Why DAFs Matter for TNS PTA

Donor-Advised Funds are the fastest-growing charitable giving vehicle in the US. Wealthy donors park money in these funds and then recommend grants to nonprofits. Getting approved by DAF platforms makes you visible to these donors.

**Key Stats:**
- Fidelity Charitable granted $11.2 billion in 2023
- Average DAF grant: $4,950
- Many TNS parents likely have DAFs through their employers
