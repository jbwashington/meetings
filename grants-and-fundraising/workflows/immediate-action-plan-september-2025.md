Subject: DOE Sustainability Grant - $5,000 for Garden Program

Hi Dyanthe,

I'd like to schedule a brief meeting about the DOE Sustainability Grant opening this month. It's $5,000 for garden/outdoor learning - perfect for our science curriculum integration we discussed.

Can we meet this week to discuss:
- Program vision and curriculum alignment
- Space allocation (considering the courtyard area)
- Teacher champions (thinking Ms. [Science Teacher] would be ideal)

This is the "lower hanging fruit" grant we identified. Your partnership will be crucial.

Best,
James
