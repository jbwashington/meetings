## Grant-Related Budget Context

### Current Financial Landscape
**Budget Pressures:**
- Two TAs required: $20,000 → $40,000 increase
- Ashokan grant shortfall: $2,000 lost due to insurance paperwork
- Need for systematic fundraising communication

**Grant Revenue Opportunity:**
- Supplement event-based fundraising ($2,000-$3,000 per small event)
- Reduce volunteer burnout from constant event planning
- Create sustainable revenue stream

### Integration with Fundraising Strategy
**From Meeting Discussion:**
> "All together, add up to a really important sum of money. So if any one of those or two or three of those gets removed, it starts impacting [our budget]."

**Grant Strategy Benefits:**
- Less labor-intensive than events
- Larger potential awards
- Multi-year funding opportunities
- Professional development for volunteers

## Document Management Lessons Learned

### Ashokan Grant Issues - Prevention Protocol
**What Happened:**
- Bus insurance paperwork submitted too late
- Lost $2,000 in transportation funding
- Grant total: $8,000 instead of $10,000

**Prevention Measures:**
1. **Early Document Identification**
   - Review all requirements at application start
   - Identify school administration dependencies
   - Create timeline with buffer periods

2. **Principal Coordination**
   - Schedule early meetings with Dyanthe
   - Clear communication about required documents
   - Follow-up system for pending items

3. **Insurance & Compliance**
   - Identify specialized requirements (transportation, facilities, etc.)
   - Coordinate with school business office early
   - Confirm receipt and approval before submission

**From Meeting:**
> "So we just need to get the required documents together. That's the slowest thing, finding out the paperwork, where it is that they need. So we can have that on and we can make it fast."
