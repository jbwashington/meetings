## 💡 PRO TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### Time Management:
- **Block 1-2 hours daily** for grant work
- **Best times:** Early morning (7-9am) or evening (8-10pm)
- **Use weekends** for document collection (people respond slower)
- **Thanksgiving week:** Just do easy tasks

### Staying Motivated:
- **Track small wins:** Every registration = potential $1K-10K
- **Visualize impact:** $20K+ = what for TNS students?
- **Remember:** This is easier than finding time for elaborate fundraisers
- **You're building systems** that will run for years

### Getting Unstuck:
- **Missing documents?** Skip to next task, circle back
- **Treasurer slow?** Send friendly reminder every 3 days
- **Overwhelmed?** Just do ONE thing per day minimum
- **Confused?** Email me or ask for help at exec meeting

### Communication:
- **Tell no one you're behind** - just start doing the work
- **Update board on progress** - focus on what's done, not timeline
- **Celebrate completions** - each DAF registration is a victory
- **Ask for help** - delegate document gathering if needed
