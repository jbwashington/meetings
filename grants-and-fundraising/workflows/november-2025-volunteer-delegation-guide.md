Hi [Secretary Name],

I'm collecting documents for our NYC Council FY27 grant application ($15K-25K potential). I need governance documents that you likely have as Secretary:

• Current board list (names, titles, emails, terms)
• Updated bylaws
• Meeting minutes from last 6 months
• Conflict of interest policy (if we have one)

Can you send digital copies this week? Or we can schedule a quick meeting if that's easier.

Thanks so much!

   I spoke with our insurance broker today. We DO NOT currently have bus/field trip insurance. This is what cost us $2,000 on Ashokan.

   QUOTE DETAILS:
   • Annual cost: $[amount]
   • Coverage: $[amount] per incident
   • Covers: student field trips, bus transportation

   This needs executive board approval and budget allocation ASAP to avoid future grant losses.

   I documented everything and will add to my report.

   [Your name]
   ```

**STEP 4: Receive and Organize Certificates (20 min)**

When broker emails certificates:

2. **Check each certificate carefully:**
   - Is TNS PTA named as insured?
   - Are coverage amounts listed?
   - Are policy dates current?
   - Is anything expired?

3. **Organize into folder:**
   ```
   /TNS-Grant-Documents/
     /insurance/
       - general-liability-cert-2025.pdf
       - directors-officers-insurance-2025.pdf
       - bus-transportation-insurance-2025.pdf (if exists)
       - bus-insurance-QUOTE-2025.pdf (if doesn't exist yet)
       - policy-renewal-schedule.md
   ```

4. **Create renewal tracking document:**
   ```

   ```

**STEP 5: Follow Up if Needed (varies)**

- **Day 3:** Send polite follow-up email
- **Day 5:** Call again
- **Day 7:** Alert James that broker is slow

Follow-up email template:
```
Subject: Following up - TNS PTA insurance certificates

Hi [Broker Name],

I called on [date] requesting current certificates of insurance for The Neighborhood School PTA.

Can you please send these today? We have grant application deadlines approaching and these documents are required.

1. General liability certificate
2. Directors & Officers certificate
3. Bus/transportation certificate (or confirmation we don't have this)

Please email PDFs to: [your email]

Thank you,
[Your Name]
The Neighborhood School PTA
```

**STEP 6: Update Document Inventory (10 min)**

Add to spreadsheet from Tasks 4A and 4B:

| Document | Status | Date Collected | Renewal Date | Notes |

| General Liability | ✅ Have | Nov 22 | July 1, 2026 | $1M coverage |
| D&O Insurance | ✅ Have | Nov 22 | July 1, 2026 | Active |
| Bus Insurance | ❌ MISSING | - | N/A | Quote obtained |

**STEP 7: If Board Needs to Purchase Bus Insurance (30 min)**

If you discover bus insurance is missing:

1. **Create brief presentation for executive board:**
   ```
   # Bus Insurance Gap - Board Action Required

   ## Problem:
   Missing bus insurance cost TNS $2,000 on Ashokan grant

   ## Solution:
   Add bus/field trip insurance to PTA policy

   ## Cost:
   $[X]/year quote from [Broker]

   ## Coverage:
   • Student transportation for field trips
   • [Coverage details from quote]

   ## Recommendation:
   Approve budget allocation and purchase before next grant cycle

   ## Timeline:
   • Board approval: December meeting
   • Purchase: Before Dec 31, 2025
   • Effective: Jan 1, 2026
   ```

2. **Send to James to present at next meeting**

3. **Offer to help:**
   - "I can coordinate with broker to finalize purchase once approved"
   - "I can add this to budget tracking"

#### What to Do If You Get Stuck:
- **Broker not responding:** Try calling instead of email; email has longer delays
- **Can't reach broker:** Contact Treasurer to help escalate
- **Certificates look wrong:** Ask broker to correct and reissue
- **Confused about coverage:** Ask broker to explain on phone
- **Bus insurance is expensive:** Get quote anyway; board will decide

Email James Washington with:

- ✅ Certificate PDFs in Google Drive (share link)
- ✅ Renewal schedule created
- ⚠️ **BUS INSURANCE STATUS** (clearly state: have it or don't have it)

| Sustainable after grant | | |
| Easy to implement | | |
| **TOTAL SCORE** | **/60** | |

**STEP 4: Make Your Recommendation (15 min)**

Based on research and evaluation:

**MY RECOMMENDATION:** [Option A/B/C]

**REASONING:**
1. Harvey's priorities: [How does this align?]
2. TNS needs: [How does this address them?]
3. Feasibility: [Can TNS actually do this?]
4. Impact: [How many students/families benefit?]
5. Sustainability: [Will this continue beyond grant?]

**STRENGTHS:**
- [List 3-4 key strengths]

**POTENTIAL CHALLENGES:**
- [List 2-3 challenges]
- [How to address each]

**ALTERNATIVE IF THIS DOESN'T WORK:**
- [Second choice program]
- [Why]

**STEP 5: Get Feedback Before Finalizing (varies)**

Before Task 5B (writing narrative), share your recommendation:

1. **Email James Washington with your full analysis**
2. **Request 15-min phone call if he's available**
3. **Get his input before moving forward**
4. **Ask:** "Does this make sense given what you know about Harvey and TNS?"
5. **Adjust if needed based on feedback**

#### Decision-Making Tips:
- **Harvey's priorities > TNS wishes** - Funders give to their priorities, not yours
- **Clear impact > Vague goals** - "30 Chromebooks" beats "improve technology"
- **More students > Deeper impact** - Generally, breadth wins for elected officials
- **Easy to understand > Complex programs** - Harvey's staff needs to explain this
- **Data you can collect > Hard to measure** - Think about how you'll prove success

#### What to Do If You Get Stuck:
- **Can't find Harvey's priorities:** Call his office (see Task 5D) and ask directly
- **All options seem equal:** Choose Family/ESL - typically strongest for elected officials
- **TNS needs unclear:** Go with option that benefits most students (Tech or Arts)
- **Can't decide:** Email summary to James and ask him to make final call

#### How to Report Completion:
Email James Washington with:
- ✅ Research summary (Harvey's priorities)
- ✅ TNS needs analysis
- ✅ All 3 options evaluated with scores
- ✅ Clear recommendation with reasoning
- ✅ Request his approval before moving to Task 5B

Subject line: "NYC Council Grant: Program Recommendation for Your Approval"

#### Resources:
- **Harvey's Office:** 212-979-9696 / district74@council.nyc.gov
- **Principal Dyanthe:** [Get contact from James]
- **Past funding examples:** Search NYC Open Data portal

**STEP 2: Write First Draft - Morning Session (1.5 hours)**

**Write straight through without editing.** Don't stop to perfect sentences. Get ideas down.

**A. PROBLEM STATEMENT (~20 min)**

Template to adapt:
```
The Neighborhood School serves 350+ diverse K-5 students in Manhattan, with 40% qualifying for free or reduced lunch. While our student body thrives academically, [INSERT SPECIFIC PROBLEM].

[EXPLAIN WHO IS AFFECTED AND HOW. Be specific with numbers/examples.]

[EXPLAIN WHY THIS MATTERS NOW. Connect to equity, access, or community needs.]
```

**Example for Family/ESL program:**
```
The Neighborhood School serves 350+ diverse K-5 students in Manhattan, with 40% qualifying for free or reduced lunch. While our student body thrives academically, many immigrant families face language barriers that prevent full engagement in their children's education.

Parents who cannot read school communications in English miss important deadlines, conferences, and opportunities to support their children's learning. Families unable to navigate the complex NYC school system struggle to advocate for their students' needs. This gap in parent engagement directly impacts student success and family connection to our school community.

With over 60 families speaking Spanish, Bengali, Mandarin, or other languages at home, bridging this communication divide is essential for educational equity at TNS.
```

**B. PROPOSED SOLUTION (~40 min)**

**Paragraph 1: Overview**
```
The TNS PTA requests $[AMOUNT] to launch [PROGRAM NAME]. This program will [BRIEF OVERVIEW OF WHAT IT DOES] over [TIMEFRAME].

Specifically, we will:
• [Activity 1 with details]
• [Activity 2 with details]
• [Activity 3 with details]
• [Activity 4 with details]
```

**Paragraph 2: Implementation**
```
[WHO] will coordinate the program, working closely with [PARTNERS/STAKEHOLDERS]. [EXPLAIN LOGISTICS - when, where, how often].

[ADDRESS ANY POTENTIAL QUESTIONS: How will you recruit participants? What qualifications do instructors have? How will you ensure quality?]

This approach is informed by [BEST PRACTICES, SIMILAR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS, OR COMMUNITY INPUT].
```

**C. TARGET POPULATION (~15 min)**
```
This program will directly serve [NUMBER] [students/families/parents] at The Neighborhood School. Our student population is [DEMOGRAPHIC DETAILS: % FRL, languages spoken, diversity stats, grade levels].

We will prioritize [SPECIFIC SUBGROUP IF APPLICABLE: immigrant families, students without home technology, etc.] while ensuring the program benefits the broader TNS community. [EXPLAIN HOW ALL STUDENTS ULTIMATELY BENEFIT even if directly serving subset].
```

**D. TIMELINE (~15 min)**

Create clear timeline with realistic dates:
```
• January-February 2026: Hire staff, finalize curriculum, recruit participants
• March 2026: Program launch
• March-June 2026: [Activity happens X times per week/month]
• June 2026: Mid-year evaluation and adjustments
• September-December 2026: Program continues
• December 2026: Final evaluation and outcomes reporting
• January 2027 and beyond: Program sustainability through [PTA budget/partnerships]
```

**E. EXPECTED OUTCOMES (~15 min)**

Be specific and measurable:
```
By December 2026, we expect to achieve:
• [Quantifiable outcome 1]: [Example: "60 parents complete ESL program"]
• [Quantifiable outcome 2]: [Example: "100% of classroom communications translated"]
• [Quantifiable outcome 3]: [Example: "75% increase in parent attendance at school events"]

We will measure success through:
• [Measurement method 1]: [Example: "Pre/post language assessments"]
• [Measurement method 2]: [Example: "Attendance tracking"]
• [Measurement method 3]: [Example: "Parent satisfaction surveys"]

These outcomes will directly support [STUDENT SUCCESS INDICATORS] and strengthen [SCHOOL COMMUNITY GOALS].
```

**F. SUSTAINABILITY (~15 min)**
```
This program is designed for long-term sustainability beyond Council Member Epstein's initial investment. The TNS PTA commits to:
• [Specific commitment]: [Example: "Allocating $5,000 annually from PTA budget"]
• [Resource commitment]: [Example: "Recruiting volunteer coordinators"]
• [Partnership plan]: [Example: "Partnering with local community organizations for in-kind support"]

By [YEAR], we anticipate this program will be fully integrated into TNS operations and funded through [COMBINATION OF PTA BUDGET, FUNDRAISING, AND PARTNERSHIPS]. Council Member Epstein's seed funding will allow us to pilot, refine, and prove the model before sustaining it independently.
```

**STEP 3: Break for Lunch/Walk (30 min)**

Step away from the document completely. Your brain needs a reset before editing.

**STEP 4: Edit and Polish - Afternoon Session (1 hour)**

**A. First editing pass - Structure (20 min)**

[Your name]
```

**STEP 7: Incorporate Feedback and Finalize (30 min)**

- Review all comments
- Make changes that strengthen narrative
- Discuss any disagreements with James
- Create "FINAL" version
- Save as: `nyc-council-fy27-narrative-FINAL.docx` AND `.pdf`

#### Writing Tips - DO:
✅ **Be specific:** "30 Chromebooks for students" not "technology support"
✅ **Use active voice:** "We will provide" not "Will be provided"
✅ **Tell stories:** Brief example of a family/student affected
✅ **Show implementation plan:** Demonstrate you can actually do this
✅ **Emphasize equity:** Connect to access, diversity, underserved populations
✅ **Align with funder:** Use Harvey's language from your research

#### Writing Tips - DON'T:
❌ **Use jargon:** Avoid education buzzwords and acronyms
❌ **Make it too long:** 2-3 pages maximum
❌ **Forget to proofread:** Typos hurt credibility
❌ **Oversell:** Be realistic, not grandiose
❌ **Ignore budget:** Narrative must match budget exactly
❌ **Be vague:** Every claim needs specifics or numbers

#### What to Do If You Get Stuck:
- **Writer's block:** Use the templates/examples provided, then customize
- **Section doesn't flow:** Step away for 30 min, come back fresh
- **Can't think of outcomes:** Ask: "If this succeeds, what would we see?"
- **Too wordy:** Use Hemingway App (hemingwayapp.com) to simplify
- **Need inspiration:** Search "NYC Council discretionary funding award" for examples

- **Use realistic costs** (research salaries, supplies, etc.)
- **Provide justification for every line item**
- **Treasurer must review and approve before submission**

#### Step-by-Step Instructions:

**STEP 1: Create Budget Template (20 min)**

Open Excel or Google Sheets and create this structure:

**COLUMNS:**
| A: Category | B: Item Description | C: Quantity | D: Unit Cost | E: Total Cost | F: Justification |

**ROWS: Budget Categories**
1. PERSONNEL/STAFFING
2. SUPPLIES & MATERIALS
3. EQUIPMENT
4. PROGRAMMING COSTS
5. ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS
6. CONTINGENCY (10%)
7. **TOTAL**

**Set up formulas:**
- Column E (Total Cost) = Column C × Column D
- TOTAL row = SUM of all category totals
- CONTINGENCY = TOTAL (before contingency) × 0.10

**STEP 2: Review Narrative for All Program Components (15 min)**

Go through Task 5B narrative with highlighter:
- Highlight every specific component, activity, or resource mentioned
- Make list of everything that needs funding:

Example for Family/ESL program:
```
FROM NARRATIVE - NEEDS BUDGET LINES FOR:
□ ESL instructor (how many hours?)
□ Childcare during classes
□ Workshop facilitators (how many workshops?)
□ Event coordinators (how many events?)
□ ESL materials/workbooks
□ Translation services
□ Space rental (if needed)
□ Event supplies
□ Workshop materials
□ Marketing/outreach
□ Evaluation/assessment
```

**STEP 3: Research Realistic Costs (30 min)**

For each budget item, research typical NYC costs:

**A. Personnel costs:**
- Google: "ESL instructor hourly rate NYC"
- Check job sites: Indeed, Glassdoor
- Call similar organizations if possible
- Consider: Are they certified? Experience level?
- Typical ranges:
  - ESL instructor (certified): $60-100/hour
  - Workshop facilitator: $75-150/hour
  - Childcare provider: $20-30/hour
  - Artist-in-residence: $75-150/hour
  - Teaching artist: $50-100/hour
  - Tech instructor: $60-100/hour

**B. Supplies/Materials:**
- Check Amazon, school supply sites for real prices
- Example: ESL workbook sets $30-50 each
- Art supplies: Research bulk classroom sets
- Technology: Check actual Chromebook prices ($250-350 each)

**C. Programming costs:**
- Museum admission: Check actual rates (often $10-15/student)
- Transportation: Bus rental $500-800/trip
- Space rental: Community spaces $100-400/session

**D. Services:**
- Translation services: $40-75/hour depending on language
- Printing/copying: $0.10-0.25/page for bulk

**TAKE NOTES with sources:**
```
COST RESEARCH NOTES:

ESL Instructor:
- Indeed.com: $65-85/hr for certified, experienced
- Will use: $75/hr (middle of range)

Childcare:
- Care.com: $22-28/hr in Manhattan
- Will use: $25/hr

Translation (Spanish):
- NYC rates: $50-70/hr
- Will use: $60/hr
```

**STEP 4: Build the Budget (45 min)**

Now fill in your template with real numbers.

**EXAMPLE: Family Engagement & ESL Support Program ($22,000)**

| Category | Item Description | Qty | Unit Cost | Total | Justification |
|----------|-----------------|-----|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **PERSONNEL** |
| | ESL Instructor | 60 hrs | $75/hr | $4,500 | Certified instructor, 2 classes/week × 30 weeks |
| | Childcare Provider | 60 hrs | $25/hr | $1,500 | Enable parent attendance, 2 providers × 30 weeks |
| | Workshop Facilitators | 16 hrs | $100/hr | $1,600 | 4 workshops on NYC schools navigation (4 hrs each) |
| | Event Coordinators | 4 events | $500/event | $2,000 | Cultural celebration planning & facilitation |
| **SUBTOTAL PERSONNEL** | | | | **$9,600** | |
| **SUPPLIES & MATERIALS** |
| | ESL Student Materials | 25 sets | $40/set | $1,000 | Workbooks, flashcards, practice materials |
| | Workshop Handouts | 4 workshops | $150/workshop | $600 | Printed materials, resource guides (30 families each) |
| | Event Supplies | 4 events | $400/event | $1,600 | Food, decorations, cultural celebration materials |
| | Marketing/Outreach | 1 | $500 | $500 | Flyers, translated materials, promotion |
| **SUBTOTAL SUPPLIES** | | | | **$3,700** | |
| **SERVICES** |
| | Translation Services | 40 hrs | $60/hr | $2,400 | Spanish translation for meetings, documents, events |
| | Space Rental | 4 events | $300/event | $1,200 | Community room rental for cultural celebrations |
| **SUBTOTAL SERVICES** | | | | **$3,600** | |
| **ADMINISTRATIVE** |
| | Program Evaluation | 1 | $1,000 | $1,000 | Pre/post surveys, data collection, reporting |
| | Supplies/Postage | 1 | $300 | $300 | General office supplies, mailing costs |
| **SUBTOTAL ADMIN** | | | | **$1,300** | |
| **CONTINGENCY (10%)** | | | | **$1,820** | Unexpected costs, price increases |
| | | | **TOTAL** | **$20,020** | |

**STEP 5: Verify Budget Math (10 min)**

**Check every line:**
- [ ] Does Quantity × Unit Cost = Total? (check every single line)
- [ ] Do category subtotals add correctly?
- [ ] Does TOTAL equal your request amount?
- [ ] Is contingency exactly 10% of subtotal (before contingency)?
- [ ] Does final number match what you wrote in narrative?

**Use calculator to verify:**
- Add up all subtotals manually
- Calculate 10% contingency separately
- Add contingency to subtotals
- Confirm final total

**Adjust if needed:**
- If too high: Reduce quantities or find lower-cost alternatives
- If too low: Add overlooked items or increase reasonable costs
- Round final total to nearest $50 or $100 (looks cleaner)

**STEP 6: Cross-Check with Narrative (15 min)**

Open Task 5B narrative side-by-side with budget:

**For each activity mentioned in narrative, confirm:**
- [ ] It has a budget line
- [ ] Numbers match (if narrative says "30 Chromebooks," budget should say "30")
- [ ] Timeline matches (if narrative says "30 weeks," budget should use that in calculations)
- [ ] Nothing in budget that's not in narrative
- [ ] Nothing in narrative that's not in budget

**Common mismatches to fix:**
- Narrative says "25 families" but budget says materials for 30
- Narrative says "weekly classes" but budget calculates bi-weekly
- Narrative mentions childcare but budget doesn't include it
- Budget includes items never mentioned in narrative

**FIX ALL MISMATCHES** before proceeding.

**STEP 7: Write Budget Justifications (15 min)**

Each line item needs brief justification (Column F):

**Good justifications:**
- "Certified ESL instructor, 2 classes/week for 30 weeks = 60 hours"
- "Workbooks for 25 participating families, $40/set includes materials for full year"
- "Community space rental for 4 cultural celebration events throughout year"
- "Translation services for all meetings, documents, and family communications"

**Bad justifications:**
- "Need this"
- "For program"
- "Supplies"

Make justifications:
- Specific
- Connected to outcomes
- Explain quantities/calculations
- Show you did research

**STEP 8: Create Budget Narrative (10 min)**

Write 1-paragraph overview at top of budget:

```
BUDGET NARRATIVE

This budget supports a comprehensive Family Engagement & ESL Support Program serving 50+ immigrant families at The Neighborhood School. The largest expense category is personnel ($9,600), reflecting our commitment to qualified, experienced instructors and coordinators. We've allocated $3,700 for supplies and materials to ensure program quality, and $3,600 for essential services including translation and space rental. Administrative costs ($1,300) cover program evaluation and general operations. A 10% contingency ($1,820) protects against unexpected costs or price increases. All costs are based on current NYC market rates and comparable programs at similar schools.
```

**STEP 9: Format Budget Professionally (10 min)**

**Make it look good:**
- Use clear headers and category labels
- Bold or color-code subtotals and total
- Ensure columns are properly aligned
- Add borders/gridlines for readability
- Include header with:
  ```
  NYC Council FY27 Discretionary Funding
  The Neighborhood School PTA
  Program: [Name]
  Total Request: $[Amount]
  Prepared by: [Your Name]
  Date: November 29, 2025
  ```

**STEP 10: Have Treasurer Review (15 min - schedule separately)**

Email Treasurer:
```
Subject: REVIEW NEEDED: NYC Council Grant Budget

Hi [Treasurer],

I've completed the budget for our NYC Council grant application. Can you review for:
1. Are these costs reasonable for NYC?
2. Can TNS PTA manage this program?
3. Is the math correct?
4. Any red flags or concerns?

Budget attached as Excel/Google Sheet [LINK OR ATTACHMENT]

I need your approval by [DATE] to stay on track for the January 6 application.

Happy to discuss by phone if easier!

Thanks,
[Your name]
```

**Make any adjustments based on Treasurer feedback.**

**STEP 11: Save Final Versions (5 min)**

Save in multiple formats:
- **Working version:** `nyc-council-fy27-budget-v1.xlsx` (Google Sheets or Excel)
- **Final version:** `nyc-council-fy27-budget-FINAL.xlsx`
- **PDF version:** `nyc-council-fy27-budget-FINAL.pdf` (for submission)

Save to:
- Local computer
- Google Drive: `/TNS-PTA-Grant-Documents/applications/nyc-council-fy27/`
- Email copy to James Washington

#### Budget Best Practices:

✅ **DO:**
- Research real market rates
- Round to nearest $50-100 for clean numbers
- Include 10% contingency (always!)
- Show your math/calculations
- Get Treasurer approval
- Match narrative exactly
- Use realistic quantities
- Justify every line

❌ **DON'T:**
- Pad numbers unrealistically
- Forget to add correctly (double-check math!)
- Include unallowable costs (alcohol, political activities)
- Make costs suspiciously high or low
- Forget contingency line
- Use vague descriptions
- Include items not in narrative

#### Common Budget Mistakes to Avoid:
1. **Math errors** (most common!) - Triple-check all calculations
2. **No contingency** - Always include 10%
3. **Doesn't match narrative** - Must be exactly aligned
4. **Unrealistic costs** - $200/hour instructor seems inflated; $15/hour seems too low
5. **Missing items** - Narrative mentions something, budget doesn't include it
6. **Vague descriptions** - "Supplies" instead of "ESL workbooks for 25 families"

#### What to Do If You Get Stuck:
- **Don't know typical cost:** Google it, call similar organizations, ask Treasurer
- **Budget is too high:** Reduce quantities, find more cost-effective alternatives
- **Budget is too low:** Look for overlooked items, verify all narrative components included
- **Math isn't working:** Use calculator, verify formulas in spreadsheet
- **Treasurer says costs are off:** Adjust based on their local knowledge

#### How to Report Completion:
Email James Washington with:
- ✅ Budget complete and finalized
- ✅ All math verified (100% accurate)
- ✅ Costs researched and realistic
- ✅ Includes 10% contingency
- ✅ Matches narrative exactly
- ✅ Treasurer reviewed and approved
- ✅ Saved in 3 formats (Excel, Google Sheets, PDF)
- ✅ Uploaded to shared drive

**Subject:** NYC Council FY27 Budget - COMPLETE and Treasurer-Approved

**Attach:**
- Final budget (Excel and PDF)
