WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This is good enough. So I'll do the request, and then Brooke… oh, there we go.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There you go. Okay.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Since I know that Steph has to hop off right at 1.30, should we, um, go directly to the budget portion of our agenda?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I just want to say one thing regarding the… our monthly agendas.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I would love for it to be, me personally, more of a collaborative process.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Um, I… I do believe that now… Everyone should have editing access to everything that lives in the 2526 folder. I'm really sorry, I don't know why that has been so, like.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Such a sticking point for me, but I think everyone has editing access. So, you know, as we're leading into whenever our next exec meeting is.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Assume that I've put a draft in there, and as you think of things, put them in, then Brooke or I will go and clean it up and try to, you know, organize it in terms of prioritization, but it shouldn't just be me saying what I think should be on the agenda. Anyway.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Steph, Lee, it's… it's yours.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Thank you. Thank you for populating and having something for us to start with. It's great. It's awesome.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Yeah, and thanks for… I know, I feel like I'm in… sent you, like, 10 emails or something, Ellen, and I feel so bad about, like, can I edit this thing? It looks like it's all editable now, so…

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'll do. Okay.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.000
I know that you're not just a control freak about, uh… like, but it can be Google…

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Uh, drive can be very confusing.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I promise I'm not.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So, did you guys manage to talk to Dianthi this morning?

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Tomorrow, so tomorrow we are.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Yeah, tomorrow.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Oh, okay, tomorrow, great. So, you know, she did explain to us the TA budget in our meeting yesterday. I said to her, there is no way that I can repeat this properly.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Very good.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
To Lee and Stephanie, because it is so… Fucking convoluted the bureaucracy of the DOE. Sorry, sorry.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Um, so, you know, hopefully now that she will have explained it both to us and to you guys, we'll have collectively a better handle on this very strange.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Process. Um… But the net is… our $40,000 commitment rolling into this year remains.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Okay, okay. I was so hopeful that TNS was going to be, you know, contributing 15K or whatever it was she said. Okay.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Okay.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Um, so I… we haven't gotten a… Steph and I haven't gotten a chance to specifically talk about the agenda items. I'll try to…

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
as far as, like, 24-25, I think we're basically closed out. We're gonna… the rug cleaner that the teachers want, we can just…

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000
put there, there was plenty of leftover money from the teachers' expenses. We started on a clean slate for 2025 and 20.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
When he's 6, I'm really glad that they, you know, that's something that will help them.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Um, we have the sex ed bill… not that much, I think it's, like, 14… 1550, which I think is maybe less than we had budgeted, um, and it will get paid.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Sorry, I don't have the budget right in front of me. Is that… does anyone have it super handy?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I think I do, hold on. I don't know, I guess I closed it. Let me open it.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Um… So, let's see, for…

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Great.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Health education, yeah, we had 3,900 budgeted, so… Yeah.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
There's a new permission.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Huh, I wonder what that discrepancy is about. Maybe… maybe a note for a question for Dianthi tomorrow? Why did we think it was going to be close to 4 and we're only spending.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:56.000
15?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
The sexually smart, I think it's called. Okay. I forget.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000
It's like Lindsey Fram Consulting or something is the company.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Yeah, I mean, I think they might have based that off of previous years with a different company, um… Yeah. Although this one is actually smart, isn't it? Um…

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Uh, okay.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Well, worth just a further clarification so that we can be as accurate as possible with what we've put into.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
with this year's budget, yeah.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Okay.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:22.000
But we're definitely going to use the same person from last year, she said, because everybody was happy with that, and… So on and so forth.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Okay, great.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Okay.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
I'm just updating the budget with a note about that.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Did you guys send the, um, the reimbursement note to teachers?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Not… not quite yet, but it's… it's like… it's, like, basically there. We'll just, um, Steph's busy with…

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
WorkWorks this week, so…

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Fantastic.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.000
by, I think, easily by Monday, we should be able to get that out, and we'll touch base with Dancy about that in our meeting tomorrow.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Um, we know the October general meeting is…

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Yeah.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Right.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:02.000
budget-oriented, and we think that's likely to be an evening Zoom meeting, based on the alternating…

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
format.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Do you think it's great?

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Yeah, I mean, we can discuss that here. It… it seems like it's something that is.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000
At a minimum, worth trying for one or two cycles. And then we can reevaluate.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Maybe we can put it to vote, but… enough voices have… have percolated with this.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Sure, yeah.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And it also seems like for that kind of meeting, a Zoom functions, because it's really your guys' meeting where you.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Speak to the group, everyone can follow along with the screen. We're not doing this thing of, like, passing out weird small printouts that no one can read, like… It seems like a good candidate for a test run.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Okay.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Um, there's question about what the ideal time for that is. I think we just have to bite the bullet and pick a time, knowing that none of them are going to be great.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Because it's smack in the middle of… dinner, and bedtime, and bathing, and all of that.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:22.000
So maybe since it's a budget meeting. You guys can say whether you would prefer 6 to 7. 6.30 to 7.30, 7.30 to 8.30, Dianthi was clear that she really didn't want it to go past 8 o'clock.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Yeah.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:28.000
And there might even be something with their union, because she basically said if it's after 8, her and the teachers won't be coming. Which… We want the teachers because it's PTA, or at teacher.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Yeah…

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
She doesn't have to be at all our meetings. But… yeah, but just something to keep in mind, yeah.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
She does not.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Yeah. But it's helpful, especially for the budget meeting, because…

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Yes.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000
You know, she can explain the convoluted DOE stuff that we can't explain, and people have questions about that, so… I would vote 6 to 7, myself.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Yeah. So, if you want to reflect on it for…

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
6 to 7?

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:09.000
But, um, at the same time, if people are doing after-school programs, then they're not picking up till 5.30, so maybe 6.30 to 7.30 would be… a better option, because that means people can get home in time.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Yeah.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Why don't we do 6.30 to 7 30? It's right smack in the middle of these.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Yeah.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
To factors that kind of… affect us on either end.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Mm-hmm. Okay.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Okay, so 6.30 to 7.30. Um… Yeah, any… anything else specifically from you guys?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Um, that you need maybe more support on, or.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I don't think so, you know, I'm really just finding my feet right now, so it was…

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Um…

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000
just, like, a slow summer as far as that goes, so I, you know, it seems… I think I have a okay in getting an okay grasp on things, and…

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Yeah, I don't know, Steph, do you… is there anything?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000
Yeah, I think most of my questions actually are for Diane. Could we… because we do… we need to pay this TA.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Bill, um, and we have to pay for studio in a school. There are things that we need to.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Pay for now. We haven't… I haven't seen an invoice for those things, so I need to just check in with her about payment for those things, because we need to get them out.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000
The door in order to have… in order to… you know, honor the contract.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:27.000
We did get an update on Studio in a school, have her give you further update. The net of that.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Hmm…

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Is we're probably getting further screwed here. There's a… Um, both a $10,000 grant and a $15,000 grant.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:44.000
The $10,000 grant is built into, I guess this was my understanding, what Studio in a School has pretty much.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:52.000
Historically always offered us, and that's directly related to the arts funding that CBOs get.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Okay.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:10.000
That's been cut, they don't have that money. Further, we're not yet sure, and won't know until October whether we get that $15,000, which is a specific grant that principals apply for. She says, we've gotten it in the past.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
We didn't get it last year. I'm hopeful we get it this year.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I don't know, won't know until October. There are two tiers of cost for Studio in a school. One is.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Basically 22, and 1 is basically 30K. Um, if we get nothing.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Mm-hmm.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Meaning, we don't get the 15, and we don't have the 10. We're fully on the hook for 22, which would be the shorter.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000
No, no, it was, like, 20… it was, like, 27. 22 was last year.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Yeah, 22 is last year, yeah.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Oh, sorry, so it's either 27 or 30. If we get the 15, then it's half of that cost, and we'd go for the higher… we'd essentially add 3 weeks of additional programming ad hoc.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Mm-hmm.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Given that we would have that additional $15,000. If we… if we don't get it, and what we are signing up for right now is the less expensive, which is 3 weeks.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Less of instruction. And that's 27.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Okay. All right, I'm just making a note in the budget, um.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Okay. So… hopefully we'll get this.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Um, principal discretionary grant for studio in a school. Um, so that we can retain the usual amount of instruction and a normal contract. If not.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Then we're on the hook for $27,000, and it's 3 weeks less of instructions.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Okay. Okay. All right.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Correct. Correct.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Um, as far as Friday goes, Lee, I can, you know, like.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Amplify, but I think the main deal for Friday is. Just, you know, saying who you are and what you… what you think.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.000
The… the finance committee and the treasurer roles kind of cover.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Um, you know, why you think it's interesting and an important opportunity for parents to be involved in, and, like, short and sweet, and.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Upbeat… So fun and special.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Lee, if you want, um… If you want me to… if you want to, like.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Practice with me, or run anything by me, I'm happy to… I'm happy to help.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Okay, I'll let you know.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Um, okay.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:52.000
I know, we were texting about it, I texted staff, I was like, uh, what is the… what is a… what is a finance committee, I think I said.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000
What the heck is a finance committee? I don't know.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:07.000
I mean, ideally, ideally, you would have a handful of people on this committee, and you have a separate meeting with them once a month. They can be short, you know, they don't… maybe it doesn't have to be once a month.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000
It's… it's really up to you all, but the theory being that the more people have visibility into this.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:23.000
The more, um… the more diffuse information, accurate information is, and… and the more we… we have a bench.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Forming for when… when people want to step down, which… They should.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Um, and, you know, maybe you can chat with Mario briefly about, like, his prior years and that, because did he do 4 years or 3 years?

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I don't know, I think 3, but I'm not sure. Yeah, second.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
And this is your second year stuff, or your third? Okay.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Mm-hmm.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Okay, well, I wanna… I wanna be mindful of… of your time, so if you… if you… don't want to say anything else budget-related, we can go on, so you can grab some… some other stuff. Up to you.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Um, let me just look, uh…

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yeah.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Yeah, I don't see anything else in the budget that I need to talk about.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Brooke, am I missing something from yesterday?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000
About budget? No, those are the big…

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Yeah.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Could I actually do… I actually kind of do want to clarify the teaching assistants for a second, so… Right now, we have 40,000.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:48.000
But in the budget. Um… But… and I will learn more from Dianthi tomorrow, you don't have to explain all the details, but are we still… is $40,000 still accurate in the budget? Okay.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Okay.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Yes. Basically, basically what happened is. We didn't pay the full $40 last year.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Yeah.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:05.000
The vendor, the intermediary vendor, because they're TAs, they don't go through.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
This payroll, the DOE payroll, they go through another vendor. What was a different vendor?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Yeah. They go through an agency or something.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:23.000
From another time, and they had a cap. They can't… can hold more than $25,000 at any given time, so essentially, the vendor-fronted.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Tns, that outstanding amount there, that's… 15, 16, whatever it is.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Am I explaining this?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000
You wired 40,000, right, Stephanie?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000
So, what were the payments that we made then last year? Because we… I wired 40,000, yeah.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Yeah. Partial. You wired… And then they return some, because their vendor can't accept more than $25,000 payments. So now they're.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Asking for that money back. They couldn't accept it, but we have to pay it.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Oh! That money didn't go back into our account, as far as I am…

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
So they… I went to some account Dianthi has, I think. So, they basically fronted us money to pay our teaching assistants from where, who knows?

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Ah, okay.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
But now they're… now they want to… now they want the money.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
You make sure she takes you through each line of this process?

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Okay. Okay. Uh, so then…

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
There's a new vendor now, so… Yeah. Yeah. There's a new vendor now, hopefully, that won't be a repeat thing, but yeah, it's just a quirky.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Again… Because they have a $50,000 cap or something.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Okay. Yeah, okay, alright.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000
It happened there.

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Um, yeah, there's also the limitations our bank puts on us in terms of what we can wire, so then, you know, they need a certain amount of money by a certain amount of time, but we can only wire a certain amount of money, and we couldn't.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Right.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Right.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
So, you know, we had to do it in smaller chunks and, like, every other day and stuff, so… Um, anyway, okay, well, we'll find out more.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Could you imagine having this conversation in a general PTA meeting?

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Like…

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
We're never gonna… we're never gonna raise it. This does not leave this room.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.000
No. No.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Nobody, please, ever raise it in a PTA meeting.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000
It would be horrible.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Okay, yeah.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:11.000
But you will… you will then have a even more capillary grasp on this than we do based on our conversation, and maybe you can just, like.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000
Repeat it to us again next time. Uh, we talk.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Okay. Okay, sounds good.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Um. Okay. Um…

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So I think that was my last question about budget.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000
So, obviously, we don't have Denise and… and Cara on here.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Um, but that'll be the cadence moving forward, that we always include both of them, and whoever the SLT.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Pta rep is, and that we put them at the top so that.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Um, then they can go. We should talk about the agenda for next week, and then I do want to address Kristen's note here and talk a little bit more about, like, teacher… Um, teacher-parent comes and stuff like that. So…

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Um… if everybody wants to click over to the agenda and just… I… I wrote 3 things in there.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Um, one… one thing that I… One thing that I have been thinking about is the whole gratitude thing at the beginning.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:22.000
It takes up so much time. And… I don't… I don't know, maybe we just reflect on it?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Doing something like saying, we're not doing that anymore, feels very, like, unilateral and UntNS-y. At the same time.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
When we have a full house. It's, like, 15 minutes of the meeting.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:41.000
It's a huge chunk of time. I think we definitely keep it in for the first meeting of the year, but I think going forward.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I mean, and no one retains, it's… I don't know. I think it takes up a lot of time.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:52.000
How about we just, like, one word feeling? Hashtag… happy. Hashtag.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
I like… I like that, James. I like that.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Just pick a… pick a word, and that's your word.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Introduce yourself, and give… give a feeling word. I love it. Great. Resolved.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Mm-hmm.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Um… Oh, Brooke, uh, we should have a note out to Liz.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Um… would you… would you like to speak about curriculum Night and Fall Family Celebration?

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
She still… is Liz still our… teacher rep? That's something we could… maybe I'll start there.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Don't know. Let's find out. Can you be on that?

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Uh, Liz is now my teacher, too, so… or my child's teacher.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Perfect, perfect. And maybe it's also the opportunity to bring up the idea that we'd like to keep this cadence of having one or two exec board and teacher.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Meet and greet, convo, casual get-together. We started that last spring with the teachers, Brooke and I.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:08.000
It had been mentioned subsequent times after that, that it would be nice to extend it to the whole exec board, and that doing this.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Once or twice a year, really kind of… lets them all know who we are, and there are more than one person who maybe they can come to and…

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Uh, voice… Um, things that they might not voice via the… the teacher rep and the PTA general meetings, which is how that whole thing was born, feeling like.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000
We'd give the teachers an opportunity to say something at the PTA meetings, and they wouldn't.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Yeah. Okay.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Um, so as far as, like, the quote-unquote PTA report for the… for the meeting, what do you guys think about these being the things to hit?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Yeah, I think a real… I think… really spending time on the committee updates, like, what they are, how people can be involved, just kind of educating people of what opportunities.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Exist, um. Tatiana shared something with me, actually, from her kid's middle school, which was a Google form, just like, what are your.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Interest in volunteering or skills. To… I was thinking maybe sending that after the breakfast or after the PTA meeting, just to capture more people.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Who maybe don't show up to the meetings. How they want to be involved, and just, like, more… keep saying, like, these are the opportunities, these are…

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000
The committees, and this is what they do, just to kind of get people who don't necessarily speak up or sign up or attend things, but might want to help.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Yeah, I think what was nice about that book was, like, it…

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
was more expansive of your skill set than you might think

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
could apply, and so it, like, opened… it's like, oh wait, I do this, and that will apply some… so it's just…

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Yes.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
It's like, oh, I can't… I can't… I don't have any cash to give, or, you know, it, like, really expanded…

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
what skill sets could be applicable to supporting the school.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Yeah, I liked it a lot.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:16.000
I'm sorry, I'm eating, by the way.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
Definitely.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
You're allowed.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Um, I was thinking about more ways to share that community database where people can say.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Maybe adding a column? So it's not just your occupation, but it's maybe changing it altogether from occupation to.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Skills. What are your skills?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Yeah.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Yeah. If somebody wants to just… change that, go for it. I mean, we have, like, 5 people in that document.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Or both. I mean, I think both… both things are relevant, yeah, yeah.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Yeah, occupation, skills. Whatever people want to fill in.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
For interests, also.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
True, yep, yep. Skills and hobbies.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Yeah. Skills and interests.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
This sounds very Napoleon Dynamite, I just wanted to put that out there.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I haven't seen that movie in so long, I cannot… I think I need a budget.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Gotta have ninja skills, horseback riding skills, nunchuck skills…

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Like, nunchucks, kills… Sportline skills…

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Gotta have skills.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Um… I do think that we want to mention.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000
The… the October meeting being dedicated to budget, that, um, it'll… we'll have two budget.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Dedicated meetings in the year, one in the fall, one in the spring.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
And, I mean, we should say that October will be an attempt at.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:51.000
An evening Zoom meeting, and… Um, I mean, like, I'm a little worried that that could…

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Result in, you know, a bunch of… Well, why this, and why not that, and whatever, and…

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Um, maybe the way to kind of, like. Hold that conversation is.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:13.000
We're gonna try it like this. So that we can give people for whom the morning is not.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Available, an opportunity to participate. And we'll report back to you. We'll… we'll… we'll tell you what the…

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:31.000
You know, what the participation was versus… are, like, highest level of participation in a morning meeting.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.000
We're gonna try it. We're not saying it's gonna be this way forever. We're gonna try it.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Yeah, I think giving it a couple months to try is good, and then we can really have a little bit.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Of data, because this is something people ask about forever, and we tried and quickly walked it back when no one showed up, but that doesn't mean… I mean, that was years ago, things changed, so… We'll see. Yeah.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Right, right. Um, I… I do think that…

00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:01.000
We should bring up the fall family. We're calling it the Fall Family Fling. Originally, it was Friendsgiving, Fall Family Fling.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Um, to sort of start setting the stage, because it is our biggest.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Event of the fall, and it's our first one, and the more people are involved, the more fun and the better it will be.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:20.000
We'll mention it on Friday as well. And, you know, I think… I think we have to put forth, like.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:35.000
The… the positive aspect of it, we're streamlining so that we can be focused, and it… People can have a good time hanging out together and not feel too strained by trying to organize 50 different things. We're not trying to.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Like, um… deny an experience, but to make it a better experience.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Yeah, and to make it fun.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:59.000
So, the idea is basically everything that I bullet-pointed there. And, you know, um… to… to allow for the eventuality that somebody says, well, what about…

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:05.000
The card-making booth, and what about story time, and I think the line is.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Those were so wonderful last year. And if you would like to… spearhead story time, or card making, we would love for you to.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:27.000
Let us know. Um…

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Sounds great.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Questions, comments, concerns on that?

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000
I think that's really great and smart, because, you know, at these meetings, everyone loves to have an idea, like, oh, it'd be great if we did this.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Which means, like, without any intention of them actually doing all the lift, so I think it's really good to kind of say, these are the things we are doing.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
And if people are like, oh, it was really fun when we have this, people really like it, then yeah.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Oh, speaking of great ideas that we don't plan on executing, I need someone to help me with this original works thing, and putting together packets.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Because I'm kind of on my own now with this, and uh… I don't want the same thing that happened last year to happen this year.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.000
I'm hoping so.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Putting together packets, what do you mean by this?

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:14.000
So, like, the thing that Amy wanted to do, like, with the, like, take home, do the art, they uploaded your grandparents can buy it, and the school gets the money.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.000
Uh-huh.

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Um, like, we signed up for it last year, she said, wouldn't it be great? I kind of felt like a little violentold, just because I was over.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Great word.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Events and fundraising, so I was kind of roped in, but… we couldn't lose, so I said, why not? But then I ended up doing all of the collating, and I'm like, okay…

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Just because I'm the one that doesn't have anywhere to go, I'm stuck with the work.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Oof.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
And, uh, and then it was last minute, too, because the package got lost, because it was just me and her keeping an eye out for it.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:53.000
And so we were already behind a week, because they had to resend it, so that was the missed opportunity to get it to everyone in time for us to.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Uh, be able to sell it. So we get in front of it early, we should be good.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000
And this is, like, scanning… This is, like, scanning stuff and stuff like that.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
James?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Yeah, like, where the kid does an art. We put it in the packet, mail it, and then it gets uploaded to a website, and Grandma can buy a coffee mug.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Yeah. Okay.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Featuring it, or whatever they have, like toilet seat, or whatever your art goes on.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000
I'll help you, James, this… this year.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
This might be a good way to get someone

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Let's… and let's get some…

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Let's get nuke… let's get new people, let's get some new people in here.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Yeah, like, this is, like, a good thing for someone who just…

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Thank you. It's just for collating and dropping off.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
like, stapling packets, like, hang out in the PTA room if you're nervous about, like, volunteering for some big thing, like, get to know people.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
It's low, low lip.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000
And they'll get helpers. They'll be 5th graders who can help drop the packets off, and Denise will let us use the.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Like, office supplies. So, it takes one day.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:55.000
But it's really cool. And they're, like, great presents, and I think that if you get a helper or two, and maybe you just make that your focus, like…

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:08.000
You know, as VPs of community building and fundraising. People involved with us can spearhead really simple and discreet things, like original works.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Here's what you would have to do to make it happen, and I'll bring Zeno's.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Estimated time commitment, 3 hours. Like, I know exactly how long it takes.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Ranking magnet. Yeah, and we can make $1,000.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Yeah. Minimum.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Yeah, I was gonna say that the thing we made, according to the budget, $920 last year off of it, so…

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:33.000
And that was when we half-assed it, so we should at least be able to do $1,500 off of this, because we got extra materials for getting on early. I made sure that I beat the deadline.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:39.000
And we should be getting the packet in the mail any minute. So I need to let Agent Jackson know.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
That we have something special coming that didn't make it last year.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.000
So, get extra eyes on it.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Perfect. So you… you already know the two things that you have to say on Friday.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Yeah.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And I need… I need tech… techies to be involved with the website and help Denise and Diane.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Yeah, so I need to get back up with Alejandro regarding that. I haven't wanted to, just because it doesn't… deliver value right now. It's not putting money in our pockets, so I've been kind of, like, dragging my feet on it, but…

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Better, like, earlier than later, I guess. Because we're gonna be busy soon.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Um, as far as the agenda for Tuesday, anything else that.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000
People want to flag, oh, Kristen, I think… I think it would be important for you in.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:37.000
You know, the discussion on committees. To reiterate class parents, I think now, for the next couple of weeks, it's… it's…

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Talking about what class parents do. Um.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Oh, I want to say, who has an HR department that does corporate matching?

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Yeah, say that.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
We need to get on that ASAP before the deadline.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Um, so I'll put corporate matching here.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:01.000
You know that we only have about a dozen people on a monthly.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Sustainership on Zephy? That doesn't mean that we don't have lots of people who contribute, you know, make one-time donations at different times, but.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:19.000
I think really pushing the idea that you can sign up for $5 a month, it's the cost of.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
12 people total?

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.000
A coffee, and… 12 people total in a rolling 12-month period who have monthly sustaining memberships.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Okay, I'm guessing a few of them are here, I don't know, but… I mean, I do it, I don't know.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
You guessed correctly, Sarah.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Yeah. Yeah. No, we can definitely get…

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Yes. But… The good news is, um.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Right. Jeez.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000
Before, when we had monthlies with Constella, it would reset every year.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:57.000
So these are… I looked, and they're still going. So that's good. That's really good. We don't have to, like, re-engage people like we used to. So we just need to add some more, and yeah.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Yeah, stressing that, um. You can do a really low amount.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
I don't think that we should shy away from saying the ideal amount. Yes.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:07.000
I think it's good.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
It is $600 for the year. Sorry, that's the number. We didn't make it up. These are what these three fixed things cost, and if we want to sustain those.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000
Yeah.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
This is more or less what it works out to per family.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
But if he can't do 600, and he can do 50, do that.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Yeah, right, exactly.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Don't do nothing, because you can't do 600.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:39.000
But if you can do 600, then that… we would want that. And this is what it goes towards. In order to accomplish these things for your child, we have to have this much money.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Which breaks out to this much per person.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000
I think we should say $50 a month… $50 a month seems less scary than $600 a year.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000
But if you could do 50, you could do 75, that means you're holding back.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Perfect. That's… that's for when you get… that's for when you get them on the phone, James.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000
James, I love this!

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Oh, you're on a fixed income? Well, can you do 40.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
It might be that the majority are here in the room, to be honest. I looked at it recently,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
James, we might need you to emcee a live auction in the spring. I'm gonna start thinking about this.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Yeah, this is, like, when people have a few drinks in them.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
I like this.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Do you know that I used to do telemarketing? So, I would be great at this. That's my hidden talent, my skill is, uh… call center, calling people on a fixed income and asking them to donate to the families of officers who were killed in the line of duty.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Um, yeah, so I'm good at that. I can get some money out of some old folks easily.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Wow.

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Right.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Um, let's talk… teachers and… and…

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Class parents, Grace mentioned to me yesterday that, quote, the teachers haven't seen this document, Kristen. I did reiterate to Denise yesterday, I was like, oh, did you… were you able to send it to the teachers?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And she said, oh, can you send it back to me? So I sent it to her again, but I don't think that should preclude you from.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:07.000
You know, sharing it yourself, and introducing yourself, honestly.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
No, I've been sending your own note to the teachers and saying.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Wait, sorry, you mean sharing it at the… at the…

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:18.000
This is what I'm focusing on, this is who I am, this is this document that I put together to help parents understand.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000
What we think a class parent is, feel free to use it however you see fit.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000
And if you're having a hard time getting a class parent.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Okay.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Okay. I didn't know we were, like, allowed to do that.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Let me help you.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Just, like, email the teachers? Is that, like, okay, or…? Okay.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Oh, yeah, yeah, definitely.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000
I mean, yeah.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000
But one thing, and this is just anecdotal because it's just in my family.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Okay.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:56.000
But Felicia's mom does not like to donate via Zephy because she feels like she is subsidizing other people's grandchildren, and she wants to contribute to her grandchild's class.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:13.000
We tried to explain to her that this is how it works, but in her mind, she wants it to go to the people she thinks that, like any other non-profit, we're gonna waste all of it on an admin overhead, and only $10 are gonna go to the kids.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
You can also make your own landing page on Zephy that can say whatever you want.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.000
I think we need to emphasize that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, like, like…

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Can't you manage that messaging, James, internally?

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Oh, I can do that? Oh, I did not know that. That's the place for it to go.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
Yeah. And then send it to her with any… yeah.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Yeah.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
The other thing is, I…

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:32.000
So we need a Q&A on the Zephy page. I've got one already made. I can just copy and paste it. I'll send you a link.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Yeah, great. Let's…

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:44.000
The one thing that I was gonna say was, like, maybe we… we try to be in front of the camp thing this year, and we encourage.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:53.000
The… the two threes and 4-5s to… you know, we can help them, say, we can… we can set up a separate.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Fundraiser that is strictly for… Um, for… for camp funds to… to help people who… who can't pay the full amount.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Um… So then you can tell your mother-in-law while you're helping, you know.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:14.000
You're helping the cost of campus. Anyway, that's… that's a little weedy.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:29.000
But still, like, there's others like her that feel the same way, just like, I'm not donating to them, I'm donating so my child can have a better experience, and… I think that it should be corrected that we have zero admin overhead. We are not a.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Corporation. We're not Susan G. Coleman. Like, we… it's going directly to the school.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000
All of it, yeah. Yes.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000
I see, Kristen, that you said about, um… you know, restocking snacks in the teacher lounge.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
I think… why not just list that in the class parent thing? Like.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Also, communicating with, um. With teachers who do the snack schedule for the whole class, or I guess that's, like, everybody except for.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:23.000
The pre-kindergarten and first grade bands? Where, you know, you're assigned a weekly snack. All this to say, they get leftovers as the year accumulates, so maybe just, like, occasional reminders to the class parents.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:33.000
If… if you have, like, a buildup of leftover snacks in your child's classroom, you can bring some to the teacher's lounge.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Um. That they're short.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Yeah. But it might happen.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Oh, okay. Yeah.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Does that ever happen? I feel like it's always that they're short, short… I just… maybe Bake Squad could donate, like, ex… you know, leftovers from…

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:51.000
That's good to remember, yeah, for Big Squad, and for our, like, the breakfast and these things like that, we should just be bringing them up there when we're done.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Totally, totally.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Yeah, exactly. I almost feel like if we're gonna do that, maybe just, like, leftovers? I'm just like… Or if someone just feels like making something, they have, like, a place to…

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Bring it in, or… yeah, Roman's grandma wants to donate something specifically to, like, the teacher, you know?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
His teacher, and they can go in there, I don't know, I just feel like it's just… another thing.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
And then put the… if we got an Amazon wish list, that's a good place for that.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Yeah.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Yeah, I think, um, when Tatiana brought that up to me, she wasn't sure if it was feasible, but she was thinking, like.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
More like a set schedule in which, like, each class donates something.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000
Um, I feel like my perspective is, I'm like, that would be nice, but we also have all of these other things.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Yeah, I agree.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
So… Yeah.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:49.000
It seems… it seems low… lower priority, but I don't think that means that it can't be included in kind of your regular comms, so that.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Right. Anything. Mm-hmm.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:57.000
It's pinging people, like, oh, we had… we had a class celebration, and we have all of these baggies of… pretzels left over, bring them to the teacher's lounge. I think saying that kind of stuff is good.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Mm-hmm. Okay, cool.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Um… I know there… there are some, like.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Tech things that we need to discuss. About passwords.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:24.000
And the printers and the copiers, I don't know if we want to get too weeded in that right now, but… Um, uh…

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:33.000
More or less, I can't remember if I said it to you, Sarah or Malia, more or less, that's the deal with what we can do, or maybe Lee.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:39.000
And Denise and everyone in the office are super cool, especially if you give them a heads up. Hey, I'd like to.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Run some copies, they'll show you, or I can do it one day, show you how to use the copiers, but.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Anything that we want to do in color, we have to do outside. They don't want us to do it there.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000
And, you know, we have… we have those kind of office expenses budgeted, um.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:07.000
I personally don't think that that should come out of our pockets. If you… if you feel like you want to donate that at some point, that's fine, but… But we should ask for reimbursement for those things.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Um, and James… Can we access the printer directly from our phones and computers if we're on the school Wi-Fi?

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:24.000
So that was on the to-do list, is for me to send a printout to every single printer that we have available.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000
And to see where it goes, because they don't have a mapping.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Go ahead. Okay.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Of how to print. Nobody knows how to do it, and so I have to kind of figure that out myself.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Okay.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Um, but I'll get on it, and uh… like, next time I go to the PTA room, I'll just try to print and see what happens, and…

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
I'll leave a note that says, hey, if you find this and I don't find you.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Email Jane for… email PTA President and let me know where this ended up.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.000
I really do already feel like you have a lot of things on your plate. Let's not worry about the printing.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Oh, that ain't even the priority either. I haven't even gotten to the priority.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
No, no, no, no, no, it's not the website, it is the list of, uh.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Yeah, which is the website. Or getting you…

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Donors that we need to go through with our nonprofit paperwork and apply to.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And it's also, like, sponsorship letters from Trader Joe's, and Whole Foods, and all of these local.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Corporations that we should just be handing a letter to. Because they do donation matching for volunteers that are employees, all these different programs for community outreach.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
And we haven't even spoken to him.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Maybe… maybe, um, you and Malia and me and Brooke. Can find a time between, you know, now and the end of the month.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:51.000
And the four of us kind of talk about how. To help you two divide and conquer, and what to stay focused on for a chunk of time.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Yeah, I'd love that.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Let's do that.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Cool. So I've got this, like, work project that I'm working on, and it involves scraping, uh.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Data that's not public from competitor websites, but I have an unlimited supply of scraping credits, so I use them for donorIQ.com to get a list of.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:19.000
All of the donors in New York City, Manhattan, that are contributing to educational nonprofits.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.000
And we can just go through that list and then see what they require to apply, and then the low-hanging fruit, get that first.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
That's great.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
And that's the lowest hanging fruit, is corporate.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Yeah. And that can be the thing that you're focusing on, and Malia, maybe we make, like, a little map of.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Yeah.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Cool. Yeah, I'd love that.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Sort of collateral needed for the next handful of things, and… Um.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
It's amazing. Dirk James.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:52.000
So I know they're gonna want, like, Form 990 for the last 3 years. I know they're gonna want our determination letter from the IRS.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Our EIN, they're gonna want either audited financials or budgeted… or budget statements, board of directors list, and… char 500, I guess that's New York State Charitable Registration.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
In order for us to fly?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Uh, sounds like that's all docs that should live somewhere with the treasurers, right?

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Yes.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Treasurers slash… yeah, yeah. Give them… give them the… the complete list.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Yeah, so me and Stephanie can go over the list and then see what the bullet points are, and I've already got, like, uh… like a… like, empty templates where we could just plug in corporation names and our names, and then just either drop it off by hand, or…

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Mail it to corporate, however the best way is.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.000
This is going backwards for a second, but about this meeting of the teachers and us.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:58.000
When do we feel like might be an appropriate time to broach that, slash suggest it might happen?

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Let's just casually ask the teachers what they think. And then there, you know.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Like, they always have strong opinions.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Okay. Okay. Maybe… maybe you… you pepper that in your communication to Liz, and I'll see what Grace says when.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
I'll ask her about that.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Wait, what meeting with teachers?

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Um, kind of having one or two times in the year where the exec board and the teachers.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Got it.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Hang out and chat. So the first one is, like, meet and greet, and under the guise of, okay, these are the new exec board members, and the second one is kind of like.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Hey, we're almost through the year, how… what… what are recurring themes? What's… what's the biggest.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Thorn in your side.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000
And that's something that they, like, want, right? Okay.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Yeah, or issues. I think it's good for them to know who we are, you know, so they… They can use us, you know? Yeah.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Well, they did, yeah. Yeah.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Yeah, yeah, no. Makes sense. Yeah.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.000
And our general sense of doing it last year was that it was very positive.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:12.000
You know, there's always this… Brooke and I thought that we were going into something a little bit more casual. It wound up being everyone seated at a long table in the library, and it was very much about, um.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
What's the curriculum? Thank you.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Eo. I basically wanted to unload about EL and share what they were frustrated with, and, like, we could… I didn't feel that we had.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Anything objectionable to do, but I think it was even there, just knowing that we listened and cared and kind of know what they're up against, you know?

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:38.000
And I do think that for our body. It was really cool to sit down with the entire staff, and for the two of us to walk away and say.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Man, we have a really solid, competent, impressive group of adults.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Who are, you know, teaching our children, and to have that experience on your skin then gives you more authority.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:45:02.000
To talk to parents who are like, how come blah blah blah happened? And you're like, well, you know, these are really thoughtful people.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Yeah.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Um, what else? In our last 10 minutes.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Just a quick question for Friday's meeting. I just wanted to kind of go through what I have on my list for printouts that might be needed.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:29.000
I have the, uh, printouts of the What's Up for the Full Year.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Um, I know we were waiting on a couple of dates there, but should I just print that file as is, and then…

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Okay.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:49.000
I think so, because will you just… will you just scan over it and make sure that… Like, it's… it's clear where anything is TBD, that it's… it's in red, or there's a question mark, or, like, people know this isn't set in stock.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Cool. Yeah, great. And then I'll do the WhatsApp September, specifically.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And then, um, a new flyer for our monthly fundraising, even $5. I'll run a draft by you all for…

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Yeah, I was thinking having the Zephy QR code and the… Should we just do this FEQR code?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Try to keep everything in Zephy that's, like, regular donations, and Venmo is more.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Right.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Um, and then…

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000
One-offs, and yeah, because literally, if we can be saying those words and holding up a sign for people to scan, I think it's… They may not do it, but…

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000
Yeah. I think they might, yep.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Dr. Adjins.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Oh, that was on my mind, sorry to interrupt. So, the PTA bulletin board needs that same as F-Q-R.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Okay. I can handle that, too.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:51.000
So, yeah, I mean, I really want to do a whole, like, Pinterest-style, like, um… like, here's all of the info about the PTA, here's our…

00:46:51.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Uh, PTA executive, uh, roster. Um, and here's where you can go for resources. Like, just kind of make it, this is what's happening at the school coming up, so they can be aware of it.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
That's a really good idea.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
You know.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Can we add that to our hangout list? Because I think that would be really fun to do. I'm happy to take that one on, James, and maybe we can brainstorm.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
what all… but I agree, I think that information is…

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
is nice to just have available all the time, year-round.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Yeah. Yeah.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Star Academy has it already. We just copy theirs and make it, like, 10% better.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Denise does have a huge poster maker. Lee and I, mostly Lee, I think, helped her set it up last year. I can't imagine we can't use it, like, once or twice for something.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
That's awesome, yeah, okay, cool.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Let's do that. Can everybody send Malia a little… uh… headshot?

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:49.000
a headshot, and even, uh, like, a three-sentence bio, some, you know, like, who you are.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Um, your child is, what your role is,

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Yeah.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Some… and a fun fact, I don't know, like, whatever. It doesn't have to be, like, a…

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Yeah, yeah, perfect.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Okay.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000
So I kind of already made something like this, Malia. I'll send it to you, and it's got everybody's headshot on there, but it's outdated, so you just have to swap out a few.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Okay.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Perfect. You can even pull… I think that those, um, bios?

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
But you can pull a sentence or two from the, um… what's it called?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:18.000
from last… end of last year's, um…

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Yeah. Okay, I will look there first.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:25.000
The bylaws.

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Oh, no, it wouldn't be in the bylaws.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Yeah. Right, right.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Well, wait a minute, that information is like whenever we were putting our bios for when we were running for the position, we had to come up with a quick blurb, so just something shorter than that would be great.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Yeah, exactly.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Exactly. Exactly.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
Great.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Um, I think… I think for Friday, that's… it, Malia, and then we have… we have everyone on the different things that need to be brought, um…

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Great, and Brooke, did you need help with printing for the individual committee sign-up pages?

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
I mean… Sure, I mean, if it's… if you're printing, it's trivial.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
I'm printing stuff anyway, so… yeah.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Yeah.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Yeah.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000
You have it from last year, right, Brookie? Like, you can just… Yeah.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Sure, that'd be great. Yeah. Uh, yeah, actually, to find them. We… yeah, we have the sheets last year, so they're probably in a drive, but not…

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Organize, like, how everything is organized now, but I'll find those and send them.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Cool. And then I'm happy to get those printed as well.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:23.000
We're getting there.

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Of course.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Thank you so much. Sign out, sign up.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Yum.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:38.000
I got two dozen and a half bagels. That… I… does that seem like too much? Too little?

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
I told him… I told him to cut them in half.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Not too much.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Cream cheese. It's probably fine.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Yeah.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Cut them in half. Yeah, great.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Um, okay.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Great.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
This was my first time!

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
There's tons more to talk about, but…

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Great! No, this is good. Now…

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.000
The theme for the breakfast in the first PTA meeting is.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Good vibe?

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:05.000
This is fun! This is me want to join, and do, and help, and, you know, it's helpful, and… Yeah.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Yes. Yes. And it's not like we need to force ourselves to say that. We genuinely do have fun, it's just also stressful.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.000
It is, but I do feel like before, this current group, there was a lot of, like.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Talking about how awful and hard everything was, it's just like, this is not going to get people on board.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:31.000
No, and we're already organizing our first, like, exec board happy hour get-together.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Yeah.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Yeah, yeah.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Or whatever, matcha tea drinking session, whatever it needs to be.

00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Yes, I'll… yes.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:50.000
No, I think… I think that we, without effort, will put out that.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Yeah.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:59.000
This… this is something that is enriching for both us and for our children, and… there's… there's no amount of contribution that is too small, and…

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Yeah.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:07.000
There… there are lots of ways to do it. Um, and Dianthi's gonna give us a little rah-rah with our numbers, also, because, you know, we've got.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Two full 3K and pre-K classes. We didn't have to close a classroom.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:19.000
We have a brand new science teacher, who she's very excited about, there's.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Yeah.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:27.000
There's good energy for the start to the year.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Yay!

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
All right. Yay, go well! Go us!

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Great! Woo! Eleanor, this is, like… I've been on the PTA board for, like, 5 years, I think, or something. This is, like.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Heads and shoulders more organized than anything has ever been, so… we're in good… we're in good shape. These are great.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Alright, yay!

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Yay! Um, someone just sent me the… the transcript from this.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:54.000
And then… I think James did it. I don't know. Like, the recording, or whatever.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Recording?

00:51:55.000 --> 00:52:03.000
The last time I did… so, whenever you get it, Brooke, just forward me the email, and then I will transcribe it, if it doesn't already have one in there.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Cool. I'll just need to find out where the recording's saved to, because I don't think I've done that before, but… Oh, great, perfect. I'll forward it to you guys.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000
It should email you after the meeting at the… Yeah. Also, I think we should buy one of these accounts.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Oh, was there something?

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000
And before I forget, we need to set up a Google Voice number before that.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Two-factor requirement kicks in, so that way we can all have access to the code, but we'll talk about it later.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
I just needed to get that out there.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Okay.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:30.000
Okay.

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Okay. You guys discussed that on Tuesday, and make sure that it doesn't comport me buying an iPhone, which is…

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
No, no, no, no. We'll all be able to have access to it. You can just log into the PTA pro… well, shit, you can't log in. Oh.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Turning to James what needs to happen.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Never mind, let me go back to the drawing board.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Thanks, everyone.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Okay.
